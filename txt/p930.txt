abstract. we present a novel learning analytics approach, for analyzi ng
the usage of resources in moocs. our target stakeholders are the course
designers who aim to evaluate their learning materials. in o rder to gain
insight into the way educational resources are used, we view dropout
behaviour in an atypical manner: instead of using it as an ind icator of
failure, we use it as a mean to compute other features. for thi s purpose,
we developed a prototype, called ruaf, that can be applied to the data
format provided by futurelearn. as a proof of concept, we per form a
study by applying this tool to the interaction data of learne rs from four
moocs. we also study the quality of our computations, by comp aring
them to existing process mining approaches. we present resu lts that
highlight patterns showing how learners use resources. we a lso show
examples of practical conclusions a course designer may ben eﬁt from.

1 introduction
learning analytics (la) and educational data mining (edm) use data to in-
form and support the stakeholders about the learning behaviour [ 2,3]. for in-
stance, instructorscangain insightinto the performanceoflearn ers,and learners
can beneﬁt from personalized guidance [4].
analysis of interaction data of learners with massive open online cour se
(mooc) platforms is of growing interest for la and edm researcher s. indeed,
the automatic collection and availability of data has raised interest in m oocs
[5] for gaining a better insight into properties of the learning behavio ur. in this
context, course designers are important stakeholders who are r esponsible for
designing and planning courses. understanding how the learners ac cess and use
resources, would help the course designers to adapt the learning m aterials to
better ﬁt the needs of learners.
research on mooc data often revolves around dropout behaviour and a
notion of success [6]. this notion of success is based, for instance, on the com-
pletion of a proportion of the tasks or on the grade obtained in quizz es and2 brochenin et al.
assignments. in this context, our work diﬀers by relying on the fac t that most of
the audience of moocs is already highly educated, and many choose t o study
only parts of the course resources [7]. as a result, we do not direct our attention
to the completion of the course. indeed, a learner who does not co mplete the
course, but still spends time viewing a variety of resources, will be c onsidered as
a valid learner. just like a textbook reader who would need the inform ation of
only a couple of chapters, the mooc learner can be selective about t he course
resources. considering this observation, we choose to focus on t he parts of the
mooc relevant for individual learners.
the main aim of this paper is to gain insight into the resource usage be-
haviour of mooc learners, by adopting this view on dropout. for tha t purpose,
we develop a prototype called ruaf (resource usageanalysis for fu turelearn)
to derive features about each resource, reﬂecting how interest ing this resource
was for the whole audience, including those who did not complete the c ourse.
for instance, we determine how many learners come back to a resou rce for ref-
erence, or how many skip a resource. this prototype can be applied to any of
the mooc datasets collected by the futurelearn platform. we mad e ruaf
publicly available [8]. finally, we conﬁrm the use of our prototype by tes ting our
approach over four mooc datasets. we also compare our approac h with the
process mining method of alignments.
this paper is structured as follows. in section 2 we present related work.
then, in sections 3 and 4 we present the datasets studied in this pap er and
explain the ruaf prototype. we then demonstrate the application o f our pro-
totypeonthedatasetsinsection5.finally,insection6weconcludea ndindicate
pointers for future work.
2 related work
in this section we give an overview of related work in la and edm speciﬁ -
cally targetting moocs. after discussing the approaches most rele vant to fu-
turelearn, we take a more detailed look at questions of understan ding learner
behaviour and then more precisely at questions about video usage.
2.1 futurelearn: a growing mooc platform
futurelearn is a growing mooc platform promoted by the open unive rsity
(uk). course designers are provided with access to the interactio n data of their
learners.avarietyoflaandedmapproacheshavebeenappliedtof uturelearn
data [6]. for instance [9] provides some short insights into how futur elearn,
through developing analytics dashboards, tries to provide a bette r feedback to
stakeholders.
however, the reported works insist on looking at data in the same wa y as
traditional classrooms, in which the interactions between student s are now elec-
tronicandhence logged.thesummaryin [6] isconﬁrmingourdiagnos tic,with in
general a traditional view on dropout and the completion of a cours e,supporting
a dichotomy between success and failure.resource usage analysis 3
2.2 analysis of resource usage in moocs
mooc usage behaviour from the perspective of the resources has not been
studied as often as the overall behaviour of individual learners. ho wever, under-
standing how the mooc materials are accessed can be valuable and he lps to
improve the quality of lessons and structure.
therehasbeensomeattemptsatanalyzingmoocvideointeractionp atterns
to identify the problems in the resources and their diﬃculty level for learners.
in [10] a clickstream analysis is described that is based on the available types of
interactions with videos. this study focuses on perceived diﬃculty o f videos for
the learners and video revisiting behaviours, and provides insight fo r the course
designers. for instance, they advise to reduce the information ov erload in the
lecture slides so that the less strong students can follow the cours e better.
in [11], a visual analytical system is presented to help educators ga in in-
sight into the learning behaviour through clickstream data from cou rsera. the
study oﬀers several types of visualizations that show the diﬀeren ce of behaviour
while viewing videos of the course. behaviours such as “pause” and “ play” are
measured every second of the course. this visualization highlights t he parts of
each video that are viewed more often, or where learners chose to pause. this
informs the course designers about the parts of the videos learne rs are interested
in. similarly, in [12] the authors try to analyze video watching patter ns through
the detection of in-video dropout and peaks of activity within a video .
2.3 learner behaviour as a process
in the context of la and edm, the event logs of learners can be con sidered as
a temporal and ordered process. some studies consider the inter action data of
learners as process data and analyse for example whether the lear ners follow a
planned curriculum.
for example, in [13], methods of process mining are applied and a frame work
is introduced to help educatorsanalyzeeducational processes,a nd facilitate real-
time detection of curriculum violations. also, in [14], the authors quan tify how
well the learners follow the order of the curriculum, from the event log of the
learner. they compute for instance a feature related to the freq uency of events,
as well as a delay between the availability of a resource and the acces s to said
resource. their purpose is to compare learner behaviours.
in[15]amorecustomizedprocessminingapproachwaspresented. aninnova-
tive measurement of the way students watch resources is introdu ced. a relation
to each resource is computed for each student: the student can have watched the
resource either on time, typically after the previous resource in th e curriculum
and before the next one, or early, or late. the tool is based on align ments, which
we will describe later in this paper.

platform.wecollecteddatasetsthroughtwocoursesoﬀeredbyo uruniversityand
we were granted access to two more datasets provided by extern al institutions.
3.1 data collection from futurelearn
on the mooc platform futurelearn, each course is oﬀered with a we ekly ba-
sis. the weekly structure encourages the learners to follow a relat ively linear
approach to the course, since the weekly resources are provided to the learners
once every seven days. each week contains a list of resources num bered as ‘week
number’.‘resource number’ (e.g. 1.2 is the second resource in the ﬁr st week).
each resource can be one of the following types: a video, an article, a discussion,
a quiz, or an assessment-related item. the assessment-related it ems are tests
similar to a quiz, or peer-reviewed assignments.
courses may be provided through several runs, for each of which a separate
dataset is provided by futurelearn. the dataset contains varied data that de-
scribe the interactions of the learners with the platform and other learners. we
focus here on the part of dataset that is called the ‘step activity’, w hich contains
the temporal interaction data of learners with the mooc resource s and resem-
bles an event log. table 1 shows an extract of the event log by futur elearn.
for each learner and each resource the learner has accessed, th ere is an entry
stating the ﬁrst time the learner accessed that resource, and th e last time they
completed that resource.note that compared to other platform s (e.g. coursera),
the data provided by the futurelearn platform is less detailed.
3.2 datasets
prom course wecollecteddataofafuturelearncoursecalled“introductionto
process mining with prom”, provided by eindhoven university of tech nology
(tu/e).3this mooc covers topics related to process mining and focuses on
the practical use of the prom tool. the duration of the course is fo ur weeks and
videos are the main resource type.
the ﬁrst week is introductory, and the learners install and do basic analyses
using prom. the second and third weeks oﬀer more advanced applica tions of
prom. finally, the last week is studying a dataset through an assignm ent and
discussions related to the assignment. for this week, no new topic is introduced,
and no video is included.

additional datasets we obtained futurelearn data from two more courses
provided by the university of twente. we used these datasets to f urther test
our approach. these datasets are as follows.
nano course : a futurelearn course that is oﬀered for a duration of four
weeks, “nanotechnologyfor health: innovative designs for medic al diagnosis”.4
ultra course : a futurelearn course that is oﬀered for a duration of six
weeks, “ultrasound imaging: what is inside?”.5
converted course we obtained a larger fourth dataset based on the coursera
mooc called “process mining – data science in action” oﬀered by tu/e. the
duration of this course is six weeks. we chose this dataset so as to t est the
scalability of ruaf. we converted the detailed clickstream data prov ided by
coursera into the less informative and coarser format of the futu relearn ‘step
activity’ where only the ﬁrst and the last access to each resource are kept.
4 ruaf: resource usage analysis for futurelearn
the aim of our workis to provide the mooc designers with insight on the usage
of the resources of their courses considering all participants. th e novelty of our
approach can be explained as follows.
firstly, we note that [16] suggests that learners may participate in the course
in their own preferred way while they may be classiﬁed as dropouts. t hese par-
ticipants havetheir ownpace andselection ofthe materials,andmigh t not follow
the structure of the course as planned by the course designer. i n other words,
moocs are diﬀerent from a classroom where the students need to a ccomplish a
certain percentage in the assessment. learners are considered mature enough to
choose to not follow the entire course, and only focus on sections o f it. hence,
we do not consider dropout learners as course failures, and do not exclude them.
a second characteristic of our approach is the assumption, validat ed in the
next section, that learners tend to view resources from the begin ning up to a
certain point. we call this point the ‘dropout point’ that refers to t he resource
after which the learner ceases following the course. we do not cons ider ‘dropout
point’ as a negative term since knowing this point under our assumpt ion means
knowing the part of the course that interests a learner: from the beginning up
until this point. we call our ‘dropout point’ assumption dpa.
this allows us to diﬀerentiate between two possible reasons a learner does
not use a resource: (1) the learner has not passed their ‘dropout point’ and
instead they are skipping the resource, (2) the learner has passe d their ‘dropout
point’ and is not active any more. the second case is not reported a s skipping a
resource.
we develop a prototype, ruaf, which studies the behaviour of each learner
according to this view, and extracts a set of features for each re source, as de-
scribed in the following sections. we made ruaf publicly available [8] for the

researchcommunity. the architecture of this tool follows the str ucture presented
in figure 1.
4.1 initial preprocessing

threshold in spending time with that resource. the threshold in our a nalysis is
set to one minute. thus, we exclude any learner that has not spent more than
one minute with any resource.
4.2 dropout point
the ‘dropout point’ is the basis for the rest of our computations. w e aim to
compute a reliable indicator of when each learner ceases to be intere sted in the
course.forthatpurpose,weconsidereachlearnerindependent lyfromtheothers.
the ‘dropout point ’ for each learner is deﬁned as the earliest resource such that:
the learner has done less than one third of the resources between that resource
and any later resource. this deﬁnition makes use of the assumption dpato
attempt at capturing the earliest point such that the learner is not involved in
the remaining part of the course.
we deﬁne ‘dropout point’ formally as follows. let rbe the total amount
of resources in the studied course, and lbe the set of learners. we deﬁne the
function dwhich for any learner l∈land any two integers 1 ≤i < r≤r
returnsd(l,i,r), the number of resources that lhas done between the ( i+1)th
resource and the rthresource. we also deﬁne the property p(i,l) for an integer
i≤rand a learner l∈l, which holds if and only if for all r, ifi < r≤rthen
d(l,i,r)≤(r−i)/3. finally, the ‘dropout point’ of a learner lis dropout( l) =
min{i,1≤i≤randp(i,l)}.
for instance, in a course with 9 resources, resource 3 is a good can didate for
the ‘dropout point’ ( p(3,l) holds) if:
–the learner has not done resources 4 and 5 (otherwise it would be mo re than
one third of them).
–the learner has done at most one of the resources 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.
–the learner has done at most two of the resources 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

we can then aggregate this feature for all learners at the resour ce level. we
ﬁrst compute for each resource how many learners are still active , by counting
how many learners have not passed their ‘dropout point’ yet. in ot her words,
we consider that learners are active until their dropout point. in m athematical
terms, for the rthresource, the ‘ active’ feature is the number of l∈lsuch that
dropout( l)≥r.
we compute the proportion of active learners who had their ‘dropou t point’
at a particular resource, and obtain the feature we call ‘ drop’. in more formal
terms,forthe rthresource,‘drop’isthenumberof l∈lsuchthatdropout( l) =r
divided by the ‘active’ feature of the rthresource.
the way we obtain the ‘dropout point’ allows us to accurately exclude those
learners who are not interested in the course from a certain point w hile keeping
those who are interested but they are selective in using the resour ces.
4.3 usage features
from the ‘dropout point’ we can determine for each learner and res ource two
features. first, given a learner and a resource they overlooked, we can know
whetheritwasaskippedresource,orthelearnerdroppedoutbef oretheresource.
we then aggregate at the resource level and divide that total by t he number of
learnersstill active (the ‘active’ feature ofthe resource),so as to obtain the ‘ skip’
feature: the proportionofactive learnersthat havenot done th at resource.then,
similarly, given a learner and a resource they have done, we can know whether
the learner was simply active, or the learner peeked at a resource w hile having
alreadypassedthe‘dropoutpoint’.thenbyaggregatingattheres ourceleveland
dividing by the total number of learners, we obtain the feature abo ut learners
that ‘peek’ at a given resource (opposite of ‘skip’).
we also compute features relevant to which order learners use to v iew re-
sources. first, we choose a threshold k(two in our computations) for the mini-
mum number of resources that label the resource as done late or e arly. we say
that a resource ris don late if at least kresources were done before rwhile they
should have been done after raccording to the curriculum; and these kresources
are not good candidates at being done early w.r.t. r. formally, given a learner,
we deﬁne two functions on resource rseen by this learner. let a(r) be the set
of resources that appear before rin the curriculum, but that the learner has
started after starting r. letb(r) be the set of resources that appear after rin
the curriculum, but that the learner has started before starting r. we say that:
–rwas seen early: if there are at least kresources r1,...,r ksuch that for all
ri, bothri∈a(r) and the size of b(ri) is smaller than the size of a(r);
–rwas seen late: if there are at least kresources r1,...,r ksuch that for all
ri, bothri∈b(r) and the size of a(ri) is smaller than the size of b(r);
–rwas seen on time: otherwise.
we then aggregate these notions at the resource level. we count f or each
resource how many learners saw it late or early, divide the obtained ﬁ gure by
the number of active learners, and obtain the features ‘ late’ and ‘early’.8 brochenin et al.

‘early’ proportion of active learners who have done a particular res ource early
‘late’ proportion of active learners who have done a particular res ource late
‘back’ proportion of active learners who come back to a particular r esource
finally, we compute whether a learner revisited a resource, for inst ance for
review or reference. we count how many resources that appear la ter in the cur-
riculum were visited for the ﬁrst time between the moment a particula r resource
was visited for the ﬁrst time and for the last time. if the number of r esources
is more than a chosen threshold (which we call the coming back threshold , and
set to three in our study), we say that the learner came back to th is resource.
then we aggregate this at the resource level, counting for each re source how
many learners came back to it, and we divide this ﬁgure by the number of active
learners, and obtain the feature ‘ back’.
a summary of extracted features is presented in table 2.
4.4 alignments
computing whether a resource is done late or early, as well as compu ting the
‘dropout point’, can be obtained through process mining techniques , with the
help of alignments. this method compares a process model with an ev ent log,
and veriﬁes if they match [17]. in [15], a measure is introduced for det ermining
if a resource is done late or early with respect to an expected proce ss model. we
extended their proposed method to be able to also compute the ‘dro pout point’.
we create a process model (petri net) representing the order o f resources set
by the course designer as in [15], with a modiﬁcation. for each place sit uated
afteratransition rofthepetrinetdeﬁnedin[15],weaddatransitiondrop- rfrom
that place to the end place. this allows us to measure the dropout be haviour by
computing alignments to this model.
we applied this modiﬁed tool to be able to compare our results to [15].
4.5 parameters
ruaf can be tuned to the data of a particular course with these par ameters.
minimum of time spent on a resource : we consider that any learner who
spends less than one minute on a resource is the same as a learner wh o has
spent no time on that resource (and hence have not done that res ource). this
time limit can be modiﬁed to any duration.resource usage analysis 9
dropout threshold : the proportion of resources that a learner has not done
after the ‘dropout point’. we set this threshold to one third, but th is can be
modiﬁed to any value. it can be useful to set a lower threshold if the course
contains multiple resources that are non-mandatory, such as disc ussions, or links
to further information.
coming back threshold : the threshold used to compute the ‘back’ feature, set
to three in our analysis.
early and late threshold : the threshold for being late or early ( kin the deﬁ-
nition) is set to two in our analysis.
5 results
in this section we present the results from applying ruaf to four da tasets, and
compare our results to the method of alignments in [15].6
5.1 application of ruaf to four mooc datasets
here we present the results of the resource usage analysis with ou r prototype
ruaf for the four mooc datasets introduced.
we only consider the learners who spent more than one minute on any single
resource.with this view: the prom course had 908 learners, the nano course
had 935 learners, the ultra course had 2384 learners and the converted course
had 12026 learners.
dropwe ﬁrst study the ‘drop’ feature, which can be seen as the dropou t rate
per resource. according to literature, such as [18], we expected t o see a much
larger dropout rate at the beginning of each course, decreasing t hroughout the
course. this expectation is conﬁrmed in the prom course, the nano course and
the converted course. however, the ultra course disproves this hypothesis. the
‘drop’ feature is relatively stable throughout the course, with a fe w outliers.
in all the courses, an interesting pattern of ‘drop’ emerges: at e ach transition
from one week to the next, a small peak of dropout occurs. it may be slightly
before the end of the week or slightly after the beginning of the nex t week, but
is remarkably systematic. this pattern is the most notable in the ultr a course,
see figure 2 (note that as in all ﬁgures of the article, lighter bars co rrespond to
resources of even weeks). the outliers of the ultra course are all very close to a
change of week, with the exception of resources number 5 and 36.
an analysis of outliers in the dropout pattern shows a lack of interes t in
assignments for a very large part of the learners. for instance, a notable outlier
is the last week of the prom course, during which the dropout rate s uddenly in-
creases. this week exclusively contains an assignment and discussio ns, resulting
in only a third of the active learners to remain.
6refer to appendix a for all the visualizations provided by ru af applied to the four
mooc datasets, as well as a more detailed report of the result s from the method of
alignments.10 brochenin et al.
skip and peek the feature ‘skip’ can be seen as the proportion of learners still
active at a particular resource who chose not to pay attention to t hat resource.
the proportion of active learners who ‘skip’ the video materials is quit e low.7
figure 3 shows the ‘skip’ behaviour of the prom course for all the ma terials. the
non-video materials (all long bars in figure 3 are non-video), and par ticularly
articles,tend to be skipped muchmorethan video resources.the v eryhigh ‘skip’
rate for articles can be explained as many are not mandatory. for t he videos,
excluding three outliers, ‘skip’ is remarkably stable around 10% for t he ﬁrst two
weeks, then decreases by half for the third week, while still being st able. the
last week has no video. as a comparison, in the converted course, ‘s kip’ is stable
around 20% for videos throughout the course.
the ‘peek’ behaviour shows a stable and very low rate for all resour ces, with
few exceptions. this observation is visible in all four courses, for ins tance in the
nano course (see figure 4) the ‘peek’ varies from 0% to 2% for the m ajority of
7in the case of the prom and converted courses, for which we kno w the resource
types.

resources. the outliers (all above 4%) can be interesting for the d esigners of this
course. these resources may be an indicator of speciﬁc topics tha t the learners
who dropped out earlier had a particular interest in.
our analysis based on ‘skip’ and ‘peek’ features conﬁrms the hypot hesis
that learners access and use most resources until a ‘dropout poin t’. indeed,
the learners have done on average about 90% of videos up until the ir ‘dropout
point’, and perform nearly no action after the computed ‘dropout p oint’. this
also indicates that our computation of ‘dropout point’ is meaningful.
early, late and back the values for ‘early’, as well as ‘late’, are very low
in all courses, except the ultra course. the ultra course, shown in figure 5, is
characterized by higher values of ‘early’ (generally above 1% from t he second
week)comparedtothe othercourses.also,the high-valuedoutlie rsforthe‘early’
feature are generally at the beginning and end of the weeks. this ma y reﬂect
the desire of learners to know what remains in the course.

in all courses, ‘back’ is relatively stable, characterized by a decre ase at the
end of each week. the prom course, in figure 6, is the only one exhibit ing a
diﬀerent behaviour. in its last week, the values of ‘back’ sharply inc rease. this
can be explained by learners trying to ﬁnd answers to their ﬁnal ass ignment by
accessing to the discussions at the end of the week.
5.2 comparison with alignments
we compare our results with the work of [15], which uses process min ing to
compute when a learner sees a resource early or late. all the aggre gated features
we obtained from the alignments show the same patterns as those f rom ruaf,
whichemphasizesthatwearecomputingthesamenotion.considerin gindividual
learners, we obtain results that are identical for the large majorit y of the cases.
there are some diﬀerences, most of which are explained by two fact ors.
firstly, with the alignment method from [15], as long as two items are
switched8, one of them (chosen arbitrarily) will be early or late. on the other
hand, we request more than two items not appearing in the expecte d order so
as not to need arbitrary choices.9
second, the ‘dropout point’ is generally chosen earlier by alignments , since
the cost of handling unordered events may be higher than just con sidering that
the end of the process has been reached.10this also leads to a diﬀerence in
the computation of an aggregated ‘drop’ from the alignment result s. there are
about 20% less learners ‘active’ per resource with this computation , and on
average learners have their ‘dropout point’ more than ﬁve resour ces earlier.
as a conclusion, although in the examples studied the obtained patte rns
in the aggregated data are very similar, our approach has better r esults than
8such as 3 and 4 in 1–2–4–3–5–6.
9for instance, in 1–2–4–3–5–6, it is unclear which of 3 or 4 is a bnormal. whereas in
1–4–2–3–5–6, resource 4 is seen early.
10as an example, if the trace is 1–2–6–5–4, getting to resource 6 before dropout in an
alignment would have a higher cost than choosing a dropout at resource 2.

alignments for providing process-related insight into the data we st udy. first,
our computations never choose arbitrarily one possibility over anot her. second,
having a complex non-linear behaviour does not encourage the algor ithm to set
the ‘dropout point’ earlier.
6 discussion and conclusions
in the context of la and edm, there is a strong potential for prog ress in the
feedback systems of mooc platforms [6]. developing ways to automa tically
analyze resource usage and generate visualizations can be a valuab le tool for
course designers [10,11]. course designers want their content to r each a large
audience, this is not limited to people following the whole course. from t his
perspective, learners who use just a part of the course are as imp ortant as the
certiﬁcate earners. in this context, our work is a step towards c onsidering all the
users equally when providing insight into the resource usage.
we developed a prototype, called ruaf, that measures the resour ce usage
properties through a novel approach toward ‘dropout point’. we m ade ruaf
publicly available [8] for the research community. we also studied the quality
of our computations, in particular by comparing them to what proce ss mining
can compute and to the current statistics provided by futurelea rn platform.
we showed that our approach provides better results compared t o alignments
computation of [15], while having much simpler semantics.
we ﬁnally showed in section 5 some examples of practical conclusions a
course designer may draw thanks to our prototype. for instance , our prototype
allowsto detect which learning resourcesare skipped orrevisited by the learners,
which resources provoke dropout, which type of materials (article s, videos, as-
signment, etc.) are more attractive for the learners, and which on es are accessed
earlier or later than planned.
such feedback is valuable for the course designers to tune the res ources to
the needs of learners and direct their time and eﬀort to the parts t hat need more
attention. for instance, if the order of resourcesin the curriculu m is not followed
by learners, they can modify the order to have a more balanced cur riculum that
is easier to follow. also, detecting outliers in ‘skip’, ‘drop’, and ‘back’ ca n help
them to exclude the resources that are problematic for the learne rs, change their
type, or reduce their diﬃculty level.
in the future, our approach can be implemented in the futurelear n platform
to automatically recognize the resource usage properties, and pr ovide feedback

we can have a more detailed view on how students come back to a reso urce, how
often they revisit resources and how they transit between the re sources. finally,

be able to relate such information with the way a video is built, or with to pic
