abstract companies are increasingly embedded in b2b environments, where
they have to collaborate in order to achieve their goals. such collaborations
lead to inter-organizational business processes that may be commonly sup-

(e.g., electronic purchase orders, invoices etc.). despite the appearance of
xml, traditional approaches to edi, such as edifact and ansi x.12,
still play an overwhelmingly dominant role. however, such traditional edi
standards lack a notion of process. in other words, the exchanged business
documents are typically not embedded in the context of other exchanged busi-

1 introduction
companies and organizations exchange data electronically to perform business
transactions (e.g., requests for quotes, purchase orders, etc.). if the interchange
of data is carried out in an automated and standardized manner, such pro-
cesses may be referred to as electronic data interchange (edi) [33]. despite
the appearance of xml and its proposed employment in business document
standards [49], traditional edi standards like edifact and ansi x12 still
play a dominant role in business-to-business (b2b) e-commerce and will pre-
sumably continue to be the primary data formats for automated data exchange
between companies for years [63,35].
business process management (bpm) [6] has been widely applied in com-
panies for internal business processes for years to leverage benets such as in-
creased process eciency/productivity, continuous process improvement, bet-
ter reporting of process performance, etc. while recent academic research for
web services and business process modeling places lots of emphasis on mod-
eling choreographies of business processes [10], many inter-organizational pro-
cesses are still realized by means of traditional edi systems. however, tradi-
tional edi systems lack the explicit notion of a business process. they are
solely responsible for sending and receiving messages. hence, every exchanged
document is isolated and the process context is lost. this results in a number
of shortcomings.
shortcoming #1: unavailability of bpm methods. an inter-organizational
business process comprises one or more message exchanges between companies
for conducting an electronic business transaction. when companies intend to
analyze their inter-organizational processes they generally have to rely on a-
priori models, if models documenting the business processes exist at all. in
case there are models, those may describe the business processes as they were
planned. real-world business processes are often dierent from the hand-made
\happy path" models.
shortcoming #2: missing integration of business and process informa-
tion. the specics of inter-organizational business processes require not only
focusing on the executed activities, but also on the actual exchanged business
information. however, information combined from process data and business
performance data of the exchanged edi messages, such as edifact mes-
sages, is currently not being exploited in a systematic manner. despite the
potentially valuable input for decision-making there are { to the best of our
knowledge { no such approaches for edi systems.
we address these shortcomings by integrating a set of dierent technolo-
gies and methods, such as traditional edi, bpm, process mining, business
intelligence and semantic technologies. to this end, we design a framework
that allows for gaining business/economic insights from edi data. for bridg-
ing the gap from the current state of the art to such a framework, we identify
the following research questions: (i) \how to use edi event data for inter-
organizational process mining?" and (ii) \how to dene and compute kpis
from edi data?". as a necessary prerequisite for addressing the above two

questions, a third question can be identied: (iii) \how to extract event in-
formation from edi data?". using a design science research (dsr) approach
[32], we rst addressed each of the aforementioned research questions individ-
ually by building and evaluating artifacts limited in scope to the correspond-
ing question. these intermediate results of the undertaken dsr process were
already published in conference papers [20{26,40{42,44]. we were able to val-
idate the practical relevance of the aforementioned shortcomings and research
questions with each of three companies with which we conducted specic and
focused case studies within the edimine research project [20,24,42]. moving
forward, we combined the individual designed artifacts into an integrated end-
to-end approach, the edimine framework . in order to show the applicability
of the overall framework we again used a case study, this time using process
descriptions and data from a dierent company. the data provided were rich
in the sense that we were able to cover all the phases and artifacts of the
framework. on the other side we limited the evaluation to a case study with
one company due to the richness of the framework and since it was hard to
nd a company providing all these condential data. the edimine framework
and said evaluation are presented in this article.
the edimine framework presents methods for generating event logs from
edi messages, which in turn allow for mining message choreographies [54]
and/or process models of inter-organizational collaborations [1]. moreover,
it comprises methods for conducting business performance analyses through
the alignment of business information in edi data to business objectives and
kpis. finally, the edimine framework introduces methods for preprocessing
edifact messages using semantic technologies in order to facilitate the ex-
traction of business information as an enabler for the former two components.
in the presented approach we build upon state of the art process mining
techniques [2,5], which we extend for inter-organizational systems realized by
means of edi. thereby, we focus on edifact [11] as it is currently the most
prevalent in the edi standards family. our approach, however, is indepen-
dent of the underlying transfer syntax. hence, it can also be applied to other
syntaxes used in edi, such as xml-based business documents.
in the following section, we discuss the research questions in-depth and
elaborate on the relevant state of the art. then we describe the designed
artifacts comprised by the edimine framework as well as their prototypical
implementations in detail. next, we present the overarching case study in
which we apply our approach end-to-end on a real-world edi data set. finally,
we discuss conclusions, limitations and future work.

2.1 research question 1: how to use edi event data for
inter-organizational process mining?
due to the absence of an explicit notion of a process in traditional edi stan-
dards, every business document may be provided independently and may be
unrelated to the context of a set of document exchanges. this lack of pro-
cess awareness in traditional edi systems hinders organizations from applying
business process management (bpm) methods in such settings. for example,
companies might be interested in identifying factors that promote deviations
in the execution of inter-organizational business processes, such as individ-
ual line items that are frequently associated with delays in delivery processes
[24]. as another example, companies might be interested in learning about
performance bottlenecks in just-in-time production processes [20]. in order to
gain such and similar insights on edi-based business processes, we have re-
cently proposed the application of process mining techniques in the context
of edi-based inter-organizational business processes [22]. because such tech-
niques generally require the availability of event logs, we are faced with the
challenge of deriving event logs from edi messages.
in addressing this challenge, two signicant problems need to be solved.
foremost, for generating events from observed edi messages it is necessary
to decide what edi artifacts1constitute events and how to populate the at-
tributes of these events. in order to apply process mining, each event needs to
refer to a case, an activity and a point in time. depending on the objectives of
analysis, one may take dierent approaches to this task. moreover, depending
on the assumed viewpoint with regard to the relationship between messages
and events, either messages or events need to be correlated to process instances
(cases) in order to allow for the generation of event logs [2, p.113]. this leads
us to the following requirements for designing methods for generating event
logs from edi messages:
1. provide guidelines for mapping edi artifacts in the context of edi stan-
dards to events in the context of event logs.
2. provide guidelines for aligning process-agnostic edi messages, or events
derived therefrom, with process instances (message correlation / event cor-
relation) .
3. account for dierent objectives of analysis: analyzing inter-organizational
business processes may focus on the exchanged edi messages (technical
analysis) or on the actual business activities carried out (business-level
analysis).
state of the art. process mining techniques [2,5] extract knowledge
about business processes by analyzing event logs and are seen as part of busi-
ness intelligence (i.e., bp intelligence [31]). although there is no foundational
1anedi artifact can be dened as any structural element or concrete value conveying
some piece of business information in an edi message; hence, their specic manifestation
may vary between dierent edi standards. for instance, in the case of edifact the term
may refer to qualied or non-qualied data elements, segments, segment groups, message
types, etc. [11].

reason why process mining cannot be applied across dierent organizations,
most applications of process mining have been conducted inside a particular
organization [1,9]. this is reected in current literature on this topic. the few
publications on process mining in an inter-organizational context tend to focus
on the area of web services [4,7,18,50,51,53]. for example, in [4] conformance
checking techniques are applied to the message logs of oracle bpel. another
example may be found in [7] where process mining techniques are applied in
the context of ibm's websphere.
in [1], van der aalst approached the topic of inter-organizational process
mining by distinguishing between vertically andhorizontally partitioned inter-
organizational business processes. vertical partitioning refers to work parti-
tioned across organizations by distributing cases over several organizations
while the actual process is the same for all organizations. vertical partitioning
is often done in order to exploit commonalities between dierent organizations
doing similar things. on the contrary, horizontal partitioning denotes the cut-
ting of the process itself into pieces. in other words, dierent organizations
conduct dierent parts of that process through inter-organizational collabora-
tion. in this article, we focus on horizontally partitioned inter-organizational
business processes since edi message exchanges are typically conducted in
order to support inter-organizational collaboration rather than to distribute
cases of a process over dierent organizations. in [1], van der aalst mentions a
number of challenges that are associated with process mining of horizontally
partitioned inter-organizational business processes, including the following:
how to discover a process model when only seeing message exchanges
and/or local events?
how to check conformance when only seeing message exchanges
and/or local events?
how to identify bottlenecks when only seeing message exchanges
and/or local events?
how to correlate messages to process instances? [...]
how to deal with many-to-many relationships across dierent orga-
nizations? [...]
related to inter-organizational process mining is cross-organizational pro-
cess mining which denotes the use of process mining techniques for analyzing
dierences between organizations [2, p291].
2.2 research question 2: how to dene and compute kpis from edi data?
in order to understand the impact of inter-organizational relationships (iors)
on the business performance of collaborating business partners, they need
to be evaluated [57]. recently, we proposed the use of kpis calculated from
edi data for the evaluation of iors in order to improve quantiability and
explicitness over previous approaches [40].
although deriving kpis from edi data allows us to have measurements
reecting actual business transactions (i.e., on a transactional level), such

measurements do not directly reect inter-organizational performance on the
strategic level. in order to allow for business performance evaluation against
business objectives, we argue that bottom-up analysis of edi data for den-
ing/calculating kpis needs to be connected with top-down systems for mea-
suring business performance starting from the strategic level, such as balanced
scorecards (bscs) [38].
kpi calculation from edi messages is also challenging on a technical level.
in particular, due to the large number of dierent standards and/or versions
used in the edi realm that need to be dealt with, kpi denitions are required
on a semantic level. however, the actual calculation needs to consider concrete
syntaxes and potential semantic variability of data elements (data format, data
element name, data element position, etc.).
in a nutshell, inter-organizational business performance analysis from edi
data raises challenges including (i) dening kpis for evaluating iors based on
edi data, (ii) calculating kpis from dierent syntaxes and semantics across
heterogeneous edi data schemas, and (iii) linking kpis to a business strategy.
this leads us to the following set of requirements for developing a performance
analysis framework that integrates information from edi data sources:
1. enable the denition and calculation of kpis based on business information
and process information extracted from edi data ( bottom-up denition of
kpis).
2. enable the denition of business objectives and success factors that reect
business strategies (top-down) . allow for the alignment of these business
objectives and success factors with quantiable kpis for lifting the perfor-
mance evaluation from the operational level to the strategic level.
state of the art. most studies concerned with the evaluation of iors
(e.g., [13], [61]) tend to build upon the analysis of success factors having an
impact on iors. for example, trust [59,68,58], information sharing [48,14]
andjoint working [45,36,17] are mentioned as such factors, which are, however,
dicult to measure. in order to dene kpis from edi data for the evaluation
of iors, appropriate success factors and ways of measuring them need to be
investigated together with edi messages and their contained information.
as mentioned above, for analyzing business (process) performance one can
distinguish between bottom-up and top-down approaches. as an example for
a bottom-up analysis tool, prom 6 [62], the most prevalent academic tool in
process mining, provides several plug-ins supporting analyses based on low-
level log data (e.g., ilp miner [66], -miner [8], performance analysis through
process mining [34]) as well as business data (e.g., data-aware process mining
[47]). moreover, there are also some commercial process mining tools that have
been developed recently such as disco (by fluxicon), celonis, or perceptive
process mining, etc.
results from process mining can also be applied for in-depth analysis of
business processes for answering specic business-related questions. for in-
stance, a case study presented in [24] uses the mined model of an inter-
organizational purchase order process as well as related business information

(e.g., requested delivery date, actual delivery date, ordered quantities, etc.)
for answering questions related to operational performance regarding the de-
livery of items (e.g., \does the delivery time of line items vary depending on
the delivery point?"). however, a drawback of bottom-up approaches is that
they usually fall short of accurately reecting business success on the strategic
level.
on the contrary, bscs are a widely applied top-down measurement system
[19]. there are also several works on applying bscs in inter-organizational
contexts such as supply chain management (scm). for instance, brewer et
al. [12] discuss the interrelationship between bscs and the scm eld and
introduce approaches for supply chain performance analyses based on bscs.
kleijnen et al. [39] and chia et al. [15] study examples of kpis commonly used
for measuring supply chain performance following the bsc paradigm. how-
ever, top-down approaches are dicult to implement since business objectives
and/or strategies are often too broadly dened and, hence, too ambiguous to
relate to appropriate kpis. in addressing this problem, best practice in the
bsc framework suggests to align business strategy with kpis through critical
success factors [37].
in [55], the topic of using information from edi messages for measuring the
performance of supply chains has been approached, but best to our knowledge
the results have not been formally published. however, some of the ndings
from this research seem to have found their way into another paper that de-
scribes an approach for monitoring and controlling the performance of a supply
chain using e-commerce data [56].
2.3 research question 3: how to extract event information from edi data?
edi technology is widely used and was developed over several decades. over
time, many dierent standards have been developed. in addition, individual
standards generally comprise multiple dierent versions. moreover, edi stan-
dards typically contain large numbers of optional data elements. for instance,
names of data elements may be changed as well as data elements added and
removed from version to version. on the other hand, data elements with dif-
ferent names may actually refer to the same concept. the correct interpre-
tation of edi messages is further complicated by the complex way in which
semantics of data elements are encoded in traditional edi standards, includ-
ing edifact or x12, using so-called qualiers and qualied data elements
[11]. while current edi systems typically allow for accurate information ex-
traction from specic subsets of such edi standards only (generally by using
hard-coded interpretation logic), the automated and accurate interpretation of
arbitrary edi messages still poses a challenge due to the pitfalls of accurately
determining the semantics of qualied data elements [23].
therefore, we identied the following requirements for designing a frame-
work for automated extraction of event information from arbitrary edi mes-
sages:

leases. by syntax we refer to the specic structure of individual edi mes-
sage types of dierent edi standards and versions. since in traditional,
delimiter-based standards the type of a data element can only be deter-
mined by its position in a message, knowledge about the position of data
elements in particular message types is crucial for the accurate interpreta-
tion of messages. moreover, since data elements are usually hierarchically
structured in edi messages, knowledge about these hierarchical structures
is essential as well (e.g., edifact segments are nested in segment groups).
2. explicit modeling and storing of qualication relationships between data
elements (for an overview of the signicance of qualication relationships
between data elements, see [23]) in order to allow for a semantically accu-
rate interpretation of qualied data elements in arbitrary edi messages in
an automated manner.
3. a shared ontology of business information concepts that abstracts from
specic edi standards and versions in order to provide a common ter-
minology of business-relevant concepts independent of underlying transfer
technology (e.g., revenue, delivery date/time, address, etc.), as well as hier-
archical relationships between these concepts (e.g., delivery street address
is more specic than delivery address, delivery date/time is more specic
than delivery date, etc.).
state of the art. the need for building ontologies for automating edi
has been observed in various research works such as [27,52,46,16]. in par-
ticular, in [46], the authors recognize the problem that standards such as
edifact or ansi x12 are dened in english prose and are thus unavail-
able for machine processing. the authors of [27,52,16] propose the utilization
of ontologies and semantic technologies for overcoming interoperability issues.
nonetheless, best to our knowledge endeavors on providing complete and prac-
tically useful ontologies on edi are only sparsely found in current literature.
a notable approach for ontologizing edi has been conducted in the course
of the tripcom project ( http://tripcom.org/ontologies ). the underlying
vision of the tripcom project was to enable persistent asynchronous com-
munication for web services [28] by creating an ontological infrastructure for
business processes and business data. therefore, one aim of the project was
to dene ontologies for edi in terms of both syntax and semantics for over-
coming heterogeneity problems. as a result, in [29,30] the authors present an
approach for ontologizing edi based on semantic templates. thereby, the au-
thors utilize manually dened templates serving as a basis for deriving syntax
and semantics from edi standard specications. one of the major challenges
faced when ontologizing edifact is extracting semantics which are dened
through textual descriptions as part of the edifact standard specications.
however, the mechanism for dealing with textually dened semantics of data
elements remains unclear in these works.

the problem of processing qualied data elements semantically accurately
is also relevant when mapping edi standards to other data structures. how-
ever, current mapping tools generally do not allow for the generic interpreta-
tion of qualication relationships (cf. [23]).
in conclusion, the identied requirements for designing artifacts address-
ing the above described research questions can be summarized as follows. for
research question 1 (how to use edi event data for inter-organizational
process mining?) , it is required to (i) map edi artifacts to events, (ii) align
process-agnostic edi messages with process instances, and (iii) allow for dif-
ferent objectives of analysis (technical or business-level analysis). for research
question 2 (how to dene and compute kpis from edi data?) two require-
ments were identied: (i) allow for the bottom-up denition and calculation of
kpis from edi data and (ii) align them with top-down dened business ob-
jectives and success factors. for research question 3 (how to extract event
information from edi data?) the requirements include (i) a common formal
representation of dierent edi standards and releases thereof, (ii) modeling
and storing of qualication relationships, and (iii) a shared ontology of busi-
ness information concepts. for addressing these requirements, we developed
the edimine framework.
3 the edimine framework
the edimine framework consists of (i) a method for ontology-based informa-
tion extraction from edi messages (cf. fig. 1, mark 1), (ii) methods for en-
abling message choreography and business process mining from edi messages
(cf. fig. 1, mark 2) and (iii) a method for performing business performance
analyses on top of data gathered from edi messages (cf. fig. 1, mark 3). in
the following, these components are described in detail.
3.1 ontology-based edi information extraction
in addressing the requirements described in connection with research ques-
tion 3 (cf. section 2.3), we developed an approach based on semantic technolo-
gies to store information about the syntax and semantics of edi standards in
ontologies and knowledge bases. semantic technologies, such as owl 2 rl

[23] [41]
[64] which was used in our prototypical implementation, suggest themselves
for the given requirements as they (i) allow for a logical representation of
hierarchically structured edi message type denitions (cf. section 2.3, re-
quirement 1), (ii) allow for references between entities for capturing semantic
relationships between them (requirement 2), and (iii) allow for the specica-
tion of ontologies for business information terminology including hierarchical
relationships between these concepts as well as the formulation of logical rules
for automatically classifying data into such concepts (requirement 3). fig. 2
shows an architectural overview of the proposed ontological framework, which
consists of two main building blocks: the edi ontologies and the business
information ontologies .
edi ontologies. the objective of the edi ontologies is to provide an
abstract architecture for formalizing knowledge on how to interpret edifact
standards and messages accurately. successful interpretation of edifact
messages requires at least the following bodies of knowledge as an input (cf.
figure 2, edifact space ): (i) the messages themselves, (ii) the edifact
standards (i.e., message type specications) and (iii) abstract knowledge on
how to read messages and standards (i.e., the meta-structure of the standards).
in the edi ontologies, these bodies of knowledge are modeled in ontologies and
corresponding knowledge bases (cf. figure 2, edi ontologies ), as described in
the following. the meta-structure of the edifact standards with regard to
message type specications is modeled in the edifact standards ontology .

(i.e., regardless of specic message types) is modeled in the edifact mes-
sage ontology . message type specications and concrete messages are stored
inmessage types kbs2and messages kbs , respectively. the individuals in
these knowledge bases can be created automatically from edifact standards
specications and concrete edifact messages by employing custom parsers.
in addition to information from the standards, information on qualication re-
lationships between data elements can be modeled and stored in the message
types kb. when parsing concrete messages into the messages kb, qualica-
tion relationships can be automatically resolved based on this information, and
semantic meta data can be added to the values. for details on this mechanism,
the reader is referred to [23].
business information ontologies. the business information ontolo-
gies [41] allow for mappings of data elements in dierent edi standards to
common business information concepts. these business information concepts
and their mappings are stored in the business information concepts kb (cf.
fig 2, business information ontologies ), which is manually modeled according
to the meta-business information ontology. from this kb, a concrete busi-
ness information ontology can be automatically generated that maps concrete
edi values in a messages kb of the edi ontologies to business informations
concepts by applying reasoning techniques over the ontologies. the resulting
ontologies contain the interpreted edi data classied into business information
concepts on a unied semantic level. as mentioned before, in our prototyp-
ical implementation we used owl 2 rl as a formalism and translated the
ontologies together with the messages to a datalog program for optimizing
performance. for details on the reasoning mechanism, the reader is referred
to [41].
the business information ontologies allow for exibility and facilitate au-
tomation when dealing with dierent syntaxes of edi standards and versions.
additionally, due to the organization of business information concepts in a
hierarchical structure, business information may be queried and accessed by
referring to business information concepts on dierent levels of abstraction.
for instance, one may query for specic delivery date information in an edi
message by using the deliverydatetime business information concept. how-
ever, one may also query for anydate/time information which is accessible
through the more general datetime business information concept.
fig. 3 summarizes the process of information extraction from edi mes-
sages in the context of the overall edimine framework. edi messages and
2here, kb is used as an acronym for knowledge base .

their contained values are parsed and stored in knowledge bases conforming to

according to the predened mappings between business information concepts

can be utilized to visualize the contents of edi messages in a user-friendly
manner.
we evaluated the edi & business information ontologies against the re-
quirements mentioned in section 2.3 in two earlier publications. requirements
1 and 2 were evaluated by comparing the edi ontologies with alternative rep-
resentations of edi messages [23]. contrary to alternative representations, the
edi ontologies allow for modeling of qualied and coded semantics of data
elements (requirement 2) for dierent releases and versions of edi standards
(requirement 1). requirement 3 was evaluated by assessing exemplary cases
of accessing business information in edi data using the business information
ontologies. the results showed that the business information ontologies re-
duce query complexity and improve accessibility of business information as
compared to alternative approaches [44].

message flow mining (mfm). message flow mining (mfm) focuses
on generating event logs that reect the message interchanges between col-
laborating business partners in the course of an inter-organizational business
process. in mfm-based event logs, events correspond directly to the receiving
or sending of an edi message. such a viewpoint can be interesting for both
technical and business-oriented analysis of edi-supported inter-organizational
business process. for instance, mfm-based analysis may reveal technical prob-
lems related to message interchange, such as repeatedly sent or ignored edi
messages. on the other hand, mfm-based analysis may also be used to ana-
lyze a business process with regard to \physical" activities that are performed
in a business context if edi messages are exchanged synchronously with such
activities.
for mfm, the timestamp ,resource and activity attributes of events are
populated according to the corresponding message's interchange timestamp,
the name of the interchange-initiating party and the message type, respec-
tively. for example, a purchase order message may be interpreted as an activ-
ity \send order" in the corresponding inter-organizational business process.
in mfm, the business data inside edi messages is generally ignored for the
purpose of generating event logs, but may be required for message correla-
tion, i.e., for the assignment of messages to process instances. in principle,
the creation of events using the mfm method can be performed in a highly
automated fashion. however, correlation of messages to process instances may
require user input from a domain expert.
when generating event logs for process mining from edi messages, there
are generally multiple possible views on events with regard to the process in-
stances they belong to. consider, for instance, a business process that deals
with the ordering and delivery of goods (cf. fig. 6, upper part). the process
starts with the sending of a purchase order by a customer. subsequently, the
supplier ships the ordered goods, sends a despatch advice and sends an in-
voice. if not all ordered line items can be processed at once, the shipments
and despatch advices are partitioned, and invoices are issued accordingly. one

fig. 6: example for generated process instances and events using the mes-
sage flow mining (mfm) method with dierent correlation criteria, thereby
focusing on the lifecycles of dierent process artifacts
possible approach for examining this business process is to focus on the lifecy-
cle of individual purchase orders. a process model mined from this viewpoint
may reect that an individual order message sent by a customer is generally
followed by one or more despatch advices and one or more invoice messages
sent by the supplier (cf. fig. 6, middle part). however, another possibility of
examining the same business process is to assume a viewpoint that focuses on
the lifecycle of individual line items in the context of the overall procurement
process. in this case, one generally observes at most one despatch advice that
relates to a particular line item, as well as at most one invoice message (cf.
fig. 6, lower part). in other words, depending on the assumed viewpoint, the
involved edi messages may belong to varying sets of process instances and
may trigger the generation of none, one or multiple events. however, individual
process instances may contain at most one event per observed edi message
regardless of the assumed viewpoint, since in mfm an event always directly
corresponds to the receiving or sending of a message.
physical activity mining (pam). while in the mfm method business
information conveyed in edi messages is merely used for message correlation,
such business information can be used to infer events. for example, an invoice
message may, in addition to general invoicing information, contain information
about a shipping date of invoiced line items. consequently, from such a partic-
ular shipping date one may infer that an activity \ship goods" has occurred on
that date even if no shipping notication has been sent. events resulting from
business information in edi messages typically reect activities that represent

product ows, cash ows or other \physical" activities as opposed to message
ows. hence, we refer to approaches where business information triggers the
creation of events as physical activity mining (pam). pam-based analysis of
edi-supported inter-organizational business processes is more geared towards
a business-context oriented viewpoint. the resulting event logs allow for the
analysis of \physical" activities even if corresponding edi messages are ex-
changed asynchronously. however, pam typically requires signicantly more
conguration than mfm.
for pam, a major challenge is to identify and dene appropriate map-
pings of business information in edi messages to events and their attributes in
event sequences (\edi/event mappings"). edi/event mappings specify rules
that dene (i) what edi artifacts constitute events (\event-triggering arti-
facts") and (ii) which edi artifacts shall be used to populate event attributes
(\attribute-populating artifacts"). attribute-populating artifacts are mapped
to event attribute names. in order to improve practical usability, such map-
pings may as well use default (xed) values for specic event attributes in-
stead of attribute-populating artifacts. in other words, an edi/event mapping
consists of exactly one event-triggering edi artifact reference and a map of
attribute names and corresponding attribute-populating edi artifact refer-
ences or xed values. consider, for example, a business process dealing with
the ordering and invoicing of goods as shown in fig. 7. the gure shows
how event-triggering and timestamp-providing mappings between edi arti-

facts and events can be used to infer activities from the messages that cannot
be discovered using the mfm method (i.e., \deliver item" events).
we evaluated the mfm and pam methods against the requirements men-
tioned in section 2.1 in two earlier publications. requirements 1 and 2 were
evaluated in a focused case study on mfm and message correlation using
edi data from an automotive supplier company [20]. the case study showed
that mining process models from the company's edi data provided technical
insights on their just-in-time supply chain processes. requirement 3 was eval-
uated in a focused case study on the pam method using edi data from a
consumer goods manufacturing company [24]. the results showed that pam-
style edi/event mappings can be used to answer in-depth questions about
the company's inter-organizational business processes from a business-level
perspective (e.g., which products take longest to deliver? what is the average
duration between order and invoicing of items?).
3.3 inter-organizational performance analysis
based on the requirements outlined in section 2.2 we developed a performance
analysis framework, the edimine bsc framework [42], that integrates both
bottom-up and top-down performance analysis approaches. fig. 8 shows a
high-level overview of the framework. drawing upon (i) edi & business in-
formation ontologies, (ii) event logs, and (iii) process models, the edimine
bsc framework allows for business performance analysis using bscs. edi
& business information ontologies and event logs are extracted by applying
our business information extraction approach and event mapping approach
described above (cf. sections 3.1 and 3.2), whereas process models can be
obtained by employing process mining techniques.
the framework itself consists of (i) the bsc ontology and (ii) a set of
predened success factors and kpis. the bsc ontology conceptually describes
bsc elements such as business objectives, success factors, and kpis. using
the bsc ontology, kpis can be modeled and aligned with relevant business

objectives. in addition, the framework's predened set of success factors and
kpis allows for the automated suggestion of potential kpis with regard to
concrete instances of input data. the bsc ontology and the method that was
used for obtaining the set of predened kpis are explained in the following.
the bsc ontology. the bsc ontology is shown in fig. 9. as men-
tioned earlier, the bsc ontology describes bsc elements. they consist of per-
spectives (perspective) (e.g., nance, customer, process, learning and growth),
business objectives (businessobjective) , success factors ( successfactor ) and
kpis. a perspective contains related business objectives. a business objective
can be measured by success factors which are in turn measured by quanti-
able kpis. in other words, success factors are used as mediators to connect
business objectives to kpis. we categorized kpi into two types: primary kpis
and secondary kpis. a primary kpi is calculated by applying an aggregation
function (i.e., sum, average, count, etc.) on a metric, whereas a secondary kpi
is calculated based on several metrics and other kpis by using an algebraic
calculation expression. metric is not a bsc element but it is required as a
basis for calculating kpis: metrics are calculated on individual events of a
process instance, whereas kpis aggregate one or more metrics over a specic
period of time.
our employed ontology of metrics builds upon the work of wetzstein et
al. [67]. their kpi and metric ontology focuses on states of process instances
since it is designed for real-time monitoring of process-related kpis. in other
words, their ontology was designed for kpis that can be only calculated based
on the runtime data of process executions. hence, other kpis such as rev-
enue, prot, ordered quantities are not considered in their work. in contrast,
we focus on calculating kpis related to both process-related and non-process
related perspectives, in a determined analysis period. therefore, in our bsc
ontology metrics are categorized for supporting the calculation of both process-
related and non-process related kpis, as explained in the following. metrics are

divided into instance metrics (instancemetric) , aggregate metrics (aggregate-
metric) , and composed metrics (composedmetric) . instance metrics are based
on query statements and can be further divided into (i) instance data metrics
(instancedatametric) and (ii) instance process metrics (instanceprocessmet-
ric). instance data metrics use queries on the edi and business information
ontologies. as described in section 3.1, we conceptualize raw data elements
from edi standards into generic business information concepts in these on-
tologies. these business information concepts can be used in query statements
of instance data metric for querying data on a conceptual level (e.g., ordered
quantity, invoiced amount, etc.). instance data metrics may be employed pri-
marily for metrics focusing on business performance that are calculated from
business information in edi messages (e.g., ordered quantity).
instance process metrics use query statements that reference time-related
information gathered from event logs and process models. as a consequence,
instance process metrics may be used primarily for metrics focusing on pro-
cess performance that are calculated from event data, such as event sequence
patterns or event timestamps (e.g., order date/time). it may be non-trivial
to specify corresponding queries on event sequence patterns when there are
multiple dierent patterns of sequences of some events. by replaying an event
log according to a specied event sequence pattern in a query, relevant process
metrics can be calculated accurately (i.e., transition times between activities).
mined process models may help domain experts to identify event sequence
patterns (i.e., activity sequence patterns) to formulate appropriate queries.
aggregate metrics aggregate values of metrics by using aggregation func-
tions such as sum, average, count, etc. composed metrics allow for the use of
algebraic expressions on several metrics in order to further aggregate metrics
(e.g., duration between ordering and invoicing).
predened success factors and kpis. for addressing the challenge of
dening concrete kpis for evaluating iors from edi messages, we performed
two main tasks: (i) identication of inter-organizational success factors as well
as their related measurements by conducting a literature review and (ii) de-
nition of kpis from edifact messages based on the success factors obtained
from the review.
for identifying inter-organizational success factors we conducted a system-
atic literature review. the selection of relevant studies was based on search cri-
teria covering the topics of inter-organizational success factors, inter-organizational
performance evaluation, and business partner selection. we considered only
studies published in the period from 2000 to 2012. using google scholar3with
these search criteria pointed us to 177 qualied published works. we mainly
extracted success factors related to iors along with their measurement met-
rics used for evaluating them. more than 80 success factors have been found
in the literature review. we simplied success factors by grouping them and
assigning a hierarchical structure. in particular, success factors sharing simi-
lar denitions as well as similar measurement metrics were grouped. the total

result yielded 56 inter-organizational success factors. details on the literature
review can be found in [43].
based on these success factors, we identied a set of kpis that can be cal-
culated from information in edifact messages, as well as concrete guidelines
for their calculation, by studying a sample of edifact message type speci-
cations in various releases of the edifact standards (ranging from d96a to
d10a) and real-world industry message implementation guidelines (migs).
thereby, we considered the frequencies of data elements as well as the se-
mantics of both data elements and message types. furthermore, we presented
aggregations of these kpis in order to dene quantitative measurements for
inter-organizational success factors. examples of so-derived kpis are shown in
table 1. details on the conducted study for identifying kpis from edifact
standards can be found in [40].
the set of success factors and their related kpis derived from edi messages
are part of a knowledge base supporting kpi identication in the edimine
bsc framework. these kpis focus on measuring performance from a non-
process perspective, such as ordered quantities, revenue, etc. however, in ad-
dition to these pre-dened kpis, the edimine bsc framework allows for the
denition and calculation of additional kpis related to the process perspective
(e.g., process time, duration between orders and deliveries, etc.) depending on
the available inputs (i.e., event log and process model).
in an earlier publication [42], we evaluated the edimine bsc framework
against the set of requirements put forward in section 2.2 and conducted a
focused case study using real edi data from a beverage manufacturing com-
pany. the case study demonstrated that the edimine bsc framework enables
both bottom-up denition and calculation of kpis (requirement 1) and top-

down denition of business objectives and success factors (requirement 2) for
evaluating the company's inter-organizational performance.
3.4 implementation of the edimine framework
for supporting the mfm and pam methods, we developed ediminer [26], a
toolset that allows for (i) visualization of the contents of edi messages using
the approach for ontologizing edi described in section 3.1, (ii) mfm-based
(automatic) or pam-based (manual) denition of mappings of edi artifacts
to events as described in section 3.2, (iii) generation of events from such map-
pings, (iv) semi-automatic correlation of events to process instances and (v)
generation of industry-standard xes event logs for subsequent application of
conventional process mining techniques. since ediminer is concerned with the
generation of event logs, we consider it a preprocessing toolset for subsequent
process mining analyses. hence, the toolset was implemented as a stand-alone
application instead as a plug-in for a process mining suite such as a prom.
in order to provide tool support for the edimine bsc framework, we
developed the edimine bsc plug-in for prom 6 [42]. based on an event log
and edi & business information ontologies derived from edi messages as well
as a corresponding mined process model, the plug-in allows for the modeling
of kpis and related metrics. fig. 10 shows a screenshot of the kpi and metrics
conguration panel. in particular, in the metric conguration panel business
information contained in the edi messages and the process model are shown
simultaneously. related business information is displayed specically for each
activity in the process model in order to facilitate the denition of metrics
for the user. the plug-in also allows for the denition of kpis based on such
metrics, including the denition of their attributes (i.e., thresholds, analysis
periods, weights, etc.) required for bsc calculation. in addition to bottom-up
kpi denition, the plug-in allows for the top-down modeling of bsc models
where business objectives are aligned with kpis through success factors. in
the business objective conguration panel, dierent bsc perspectives, business
objectives, and success factors can be modeled and corresponding attributes
can be specied (e.g., thresholds, weights, etc.).
4 case study
in the following, we present a case study with the objective of evaluating the
applicability and usefulness of the edimine framework. the issue is, given the
data from the company as input, are we able to "reproduce" the respective
processes and business indicators. thus, we show that all steps of the frame-
work could be performed, and that the results obtained on both the process
as well as the business level can be "mapped" to the company's real perfor-
mance data. as input we had a sample of of edi data reecting transactions
of a german consumer goods manufacturing company with its retail business

partners. for the sake of condentiality, we cannot reveal this organization
and simply refer to it as sellerco. in addition, all monetary and quantitative
gures have been multiplied by an undisclosed constant factor.
firstly, we establish some basic facts and assumptions on sellerco and its
business processes that are relevant for the design of the case study. sellerco
declares its primary mission to be the provision of highest quality products
and services. moreover, since sellerco delivers to a large number of individual
supermarket branches, sellerco's process of ordering, invoicing and delivery
of goods to individual customers is of particular importance to the business'
success and, thus, receives particular attention in this case study. this process
starts when a customer sends an order to sellerco. in such an order, the
customer usually species a requested delivery date for the ordered goods.
subsequently, sellerco despatches the goods. this is generally done in due
time to meet the requested delivery date of the customer. if an order cannot
be fullled at once, the ordered items may be shipped in partitions. after
goods have been shipped, sellerco sends invoices for the corresponding line
items. again, line items that were ordered in a single purchase order may be
scattered over dierent invoices.
for the case study we followed the workow of the edimine framework
shown in fig. 1. we start from a real-world sample of sellerco's edi inter-
change data and generate an event log reecting the actual delivery process
execution of sellerco. thereby, we use the pam method since we are inter-
ested in the delivery process from a business-oriented viewpoint (i.e., we are
more interested in the \physical" business process than in technical aspects of
the edi message exchanges). then we mine a process model from the event
log and employ the edimine bsc framework in order to lift the gathered
information to the strategic level and derive additional business intelligence.
the gathered results were discussed with representatives of sellerco.

4.1 data set and data preprocessing
the above described business process of sellerco is supported by edi messages
that are interchanged between the it systems of sellerco and its customers.
the data set consists of 1389 received edifact orders (purchase order)
messages, 1289 sent desadv (despatch advice) and 1840 sent invoic (in-
voice) messages collected between march 1 and june 5, 2013 (dates refer to
interchange timestamps). orders messages received by sellerco were all en-
coded according to the d96a4edifact release, while desadv and invoic
messages were sent both in d96a and d01b5releases of edifact.
we used the ediminer toolset to parse the edi messages into edi on-
tologies and corresponding message kbs. furthermore, we generated business
information ontologies based on manually dened mappings of business in-
formation concepts to actual data elements of edi messages. these mappings
were dened in a way such that semantically equivalent data elements of dier-
ent edifact standards releases were unied in common business information
concepts and the hierarchical structure of these concepts reects aggregations
and/or compositions of these business information concepts (for examples of
such mappings, see [41] and section 3.1/fig. 4a).
4.2 denition of edi/event mappings
in order to generate an event log from the edi data set, we start by dening
a set of edi/event mappings using the ediminer toolset. the employed map-
ping denitions are shown in detail in table 2. since we used the ediminer
toolset for dening edi/event mappings, these mappings are based on the
above described ontological data model of edifact messages and allow for
direct access to the concrete semantics of qualied data elements.
we consider the ordering, delivery and invoicing of goods as the crucial
activities for our analysis since they are directly related to the performance of
the delivery process. hence, we dene edi/event mappings for \order item",
\deliver item" and \invoice item" activities. furthermore, since we intend
to investigate delivery performance with regard to individual line items, we
focus on the lifecycles of individual line items in the dened mappings as
well. consequently, we use individual line items in the edi messages as event
triggers for all of the three aforementioned activities.
firstly, for the \order item" activity we dene a mapping that uses indi-
vidual line items in orders messages as event triggers and populate their
timestamp attributes with the document dates of the messages (i.e., docu-
ment/message date/time ). secondly, for the \deliver item" activity, one may
consider using individual line items in desadv messages as event triggers.
however, since the desadv messages in our data set only contain document
dates as well as estimated delivery dates, this would only allow us to generate

deliveries of the goods at the customer's site. hence, we exploit that the in-

line items and dene a mapping for the \deliver item" activity that uses indi-
vidual line items in invoic messages to create events and corresponding val-
ues of delivery date/time, actual as their timestamps. consequently, we do not
further consider the observed desadv messages for our case study. thirdly,
for the \invoice item" activity we dene a mapping that uses individual line
items in invoic messages as event trigger and the invoice's document date
(i.e., document/message date/time ) as a timestamp. finally, we add common

attributes itemid and orderid to all three of the aforementioned mappings
and map them to the corresponding edifact data elements in order to allow
for subsequent correlation of generated events to process instances by means
of(itemid, orderid) tuples. the organizational resource (org:resource) associ-
ated with generated events is set to the interchange senders from the message
envelopes (i.e.,edifacts unb segments) for all mappings.
4.3 event log generation and process mining
using the above described event mappings, the data set under consideration
corresponds to an event log containing 52622 events (14026 \order item"
events, 19318 \deliver item" events and 19318 \invoice item" events). as
mentioned earlier, we intend to investigate the performance of the delivery
process from a line-item centric perspective in the context of individual orders.
in the aforementioned set of 52622 events, orderid s are unique for \order
item" events; as a consequence, they can be assumed to be generally unique.
hence, we correlate events to process instances by grouping them according to
(orderid, itemid) tuples. this results in 21215 process instances (cases). we
store the generated events and process instances in an xes log and use the ltl
checker plug-in of the prom process mining suite to lter the results for cases
which contain complete traces (i.e., having at least one activity instance of all
three dened activity types). filtering for complete traces allows us to look
only at customers of sellerco who implement the whole order and delivery
process by means of edi (see also [24] for a discussion on the implications
of ltering for complete cases). this reduces the log size to 4751 compliant
cases and 14779 events (4751 \order item", 5014 \deliver item" and 5014
\invoice item" events). further removal of 16 cases with apparent anomalies
in associated date/time information results in a log of 4735 cases which serves
as the basis for our subsequent analysis.
an analysis of the sender/receiver information in the edifact inter-
change headers of the messages reveals that in this dataset sellerco receives
orders messages from 13 dierent customers and sends invoic messages
to six dierent customers. three of these customers are overlapping, i.e., they
handle both orders and invoices electronically via edi. these three customers
account for 1574 ( ~33%) of the 4751 complete cases. the remaining 3177 ( ~67%)
complete cases originate from a fourth customer where orders are sent from
a subsidiary company having a dierent gln than the headquarters receiving
the invoices. in other words, we use the edi data of four dierent customers
for our subsequent analyses.
the resulting event log is further mined for a process model using the
heuristics miner algorithms [65] (cf. fig. 11).

business objectives and success factors. in order to evaluate busi-
ness performance against business objectives by using the edimine bsc frame-
work, we rstly dene business objectives and related success factors to be used
in the bsc for this case study. we considered sellerco's primary mission state-
ment { which is the provision of products and services of the highest quality {
and translated it into business objectives which reect this focus, as shown in
table 3. the \improve product and service quality" business objective focuses
on the quality of the manufactured goods as well as on related services such
as delivery, after-sale services, etc. \maintain customer satisfaction" reects
the organization's intention to retain existing customers as well as to attract
new customers as an indirect indicator of product and service quality. further-
more, \increase revenue" and \improve operational performance" have been
included as business objectives for sellerco, as these represent typical goals of
prot-oriented companies. note that in real-world applications of the edimine
bsc framework, business objectives may be derived from an already existing
bsc of the company under analysis. as also shown in table 3, for each of the
business objectives we select success factors which relate to that objective (cf.
section 3.3).
denition of kpis. based on the available data from sellerco, we iden-
tied concrete kpis for measuring each of the success factors as shown in
table 4. target values and critical thresholds were agreed upon and validated
by representatives of the company. the kpi \total revenue" is dened to re-
ect the success factor \financial performance" whereas the kpi \average
revenue per customer" and \average ordered quantities per customer" are
used to evaluate customer satisfaction. we set the target value of revenue to
600,0006. we consider a total revenue of less than 300,000 as critical. the

the weight of kpis must total to 100% for each business objective. the calculation of kpi scores
is inspired by adoscore ( http://www.boc-group.com/products/adoscore ). the limit type inuences
the calculation of scores as follows:
1. \more is better" indicates that actual values higher than the target value are preferred:
scorekpi =actual  (target  criticalthreshold )
target  (target  criticalthreshold )100 (1)
2. \less is better" indicates that actual values lower than the target value are preferred:
scorekpi =actual  (target +criticalthreshold )
target  (target +criticalthreshold )100 (2)
3. \two-side" indicates that actual values equal to the target value are preferred. if the actual
value is less than the target value, then equation (1) applies, otherwise equation (2) applies.
kpi calculation formulas are described as aggregation functions applied over sets of results cal-
culated from algebraic expressions. these algebraic expressions are applied on each of the process
instances which start in the given analysis period.

fig. 12: examples of event sequences that conform to the model in fig. 11
target value of \average revenue per customer" is one fourth of the target
value of total revenue since sellerco has four main customers (cf. section 4.3).
beside average revenues per customer, customer satisfaction is also reected
by ordered quantities which we model by means of a kpi \average ordered
quantities per customer".
in the process perspective, we focus on the performance of the delivery
and invoicing processes. we dene four kpis related to delivery performance
to reect the success factor \reliability": \number of late deliveries", \pct.
of just-in-time deliveries", \standard deviation of duration between requested
delivery date and actual delivery date", and \average duration between re-
quested delivery data and actual delivery date". \number of late deliveries"
can inuence customer satisfaction and trust since late deliveries may harm
the reputation of organizations. since we want to emphasize the penalty on
late deliveries, we give it a 50% weight which is half of the total score of the
business objective \improve product and service quality". the optimal case
is not to have any late deliveries, therefore we set the target value to zero
and set the critical threshold 7to ve late deliveries. similarly, the kpi \pct.
of just-in-time deliveries" reects the reliability of sellerco's delivery service.
the kpi \average duration between requested delivery date and actual deliv-
ery date" is also used to evaluate overall delivery performance. the duration
between requested delivery date and actual delivery date should be as little
as possible. we set the target value to -1 (i.e., delivery at most one day in ad-
vance) and the critical threshold to two days with the limit type as two-sided
(i.e., more than three days early or one day late is considered critical).
for evaluating the operational performance, we focus on invoicing times
and the duration between ordered date and actual delivery date. the kpi
\maximum duration of invoicing" is used to indicate the longest invoicing pe-
riod after some delivery completed. we focus on the duration between \deliver
item" events and subsequent \invoice item" events. however, the calculation
mechanism of timestamps needs to ensure the correctness of underlying event
7we specify critical thresholds as relative values (i.e., threshold ) with respect to target
values in order to allow for the simple denition of thresholds for two-sided kpis.

sequences. there are several possible event sequences that conform to the
mined process model, as illustrated in fig. 12. in the case of process instance
#1, it is obvious that the duration of invoicing is the time period between
a \deliver item" event and its consecutive \invoice item" event (cf. fig. 12,
mark 1). however, in the case of process instance #2 and #3, the denition of
what constitutes the actual duration becomes ambiguous. in particular, there
are two \deliver item" events followed by one \invoice item" event in process
instance #2. this yields two possible pairs of \deliver item" event and \in-
voice item" event (i.e., fig. 12, mark 2 and 3). the ambiguity of acquiring
the correct information becomes clearer in the example of process instance
#3 where there are two \deliver item" events and each of them is followed
by its corresponding\invoice item" event. this results in four possible pairs
(i.e., fig. 12, mark 4, 5, 6 and 7). for calculating the duration of invoicing, we
focus on the duration between \deliver item" events and consecutive \invoice
item" events. since we want to measure time of invoice response after delivery
nished. therefore, the calculation is required to be limited to the pattern
of interest. in this case, by considering the mined process model (cf. fig. 11)
we dene the activity sequence pattern such that in each process instance the
timestamps of \deliver item" events and the timestamps of subsequent \in-
voice item" events are retrieved. based on this pattern, our calculation mech-
anism leverages the concept of log replay (cf. [3]) to step through the event
log and retrieve corresponding activity timestamps accurately. following this
pattern with respect to the examples shown in fig. 12, durations between
event pairs of 1, 3, 5, and 7 are retrieved. normally, sellerco's invoices should
be issued 1-2 days after the delivery date. hence, the target value is set to
one day. however, invoicing later than one week is considered unusual. hence,
we set the critical threshold to seven days. in order to evaluate the overall
performance of invoicing, the kpi \average duration of invoicing" is applied.
the calculation of invoicing duration of the previous mentioned kpi is also
applied for this kpi. the majority of invoicing processes is expected to last
around 1-2 days. therefore, the average duration of invoicing should be one
day (i.e., one day after some delivery).
bsc calculation. according to the above described bsc model and
denition of kpis, we calculate the scores for each of the kpis. in turn, the
achievement scores of the business objectives can be calculated as the weighted
sum of the related kpis' scores. in this case study, we consider business ob-
jectives having achievement scores less than 50% to be critical. the bsc is
calculated monthly, hence, the scores of business objectives (and correspond-
ing kpis) are calculated month by month. we limit maximum and minimum
scores to 100% and 0% respectively.

rst three months in this period. there are no results for the period of june
2013 because the edi messages sent/received in this period belong to the
process instances that start in the previous months (i.e., there are no order
item events in june). table 5 shows the calculated bsc for these three months.
in the period of march 2013, sellerco perfectly achieves its business objec-
tives in both the nancial and customer perspectives. the business objectives
\increase revenue" and \maintain customer satisfaction" are successfully met
with a score of 100% since all of their related kpis score 100% as well. how-
ever, the kpis of the process perspective exhibit less desirable scores. delivery
performance { reecting the business objective \improve product and service
quality" { is much lower than targeted. there are four late deliveries in this
month, which is only slightly below the critical threshold of ve late deliveries
per month. similarly, the percentage of just-in-time deliveries and the standard
deviation of duration between requested delivery date and actual delivery date
are also achieved lower than the expectation. although none of the kpis for
\improve product and service quality" is critical, the business objective itself
is in a critical status since the overall achievement score is lower than 50%.
however, the business objective \improve operational performance", focusing
on invoicing processes, is still acceptable.
in april and may 2013, the performance indicators of the nancial and
customer perspectives drop signicantly (cf. table 5).

fig. 13: dotted chart showing the time frame of the 148 cases of late invoices.
the red, green and blue dots represent order item events, deliver item events,
and invoice item events, respectively.
in summary, the scores of the business objectives in the nancial and cus-
tomer perspectives keep falling in each of the examined months. the aver-
ages of ordered quantities per customer drop around 30% each month. con-
sequently, the total revenue also keeps declining. this might be the result of
poor operational performance since all related business objectives score low.
this may reduce customer satisfaction which in turn leads to declining rev-
enues. however, this cannot be concluded with certainty from the results since
the analysis period of three months is too short. nevertheless, the results sug-
gest that sellerco may investigate the underlying cause for the low scores of
kpis related to customer satisfaction as well as put additional eorts into the
improvement of operations performance.
in addition to these results, we further investigated the cases of late deliv-
eries and late invoices for deriving clues for such anomalies. in doing so, other
analysis techniques can be applied for answering in-depth questions, such as
\what are factors aecting delivery performance?", \how much does customer
satisfaction depend on operational performance?", etc. (cf. [24]). with regard
to cases with late deliveries, we found that two of the ve late-delivery cases
feature ordered quantities more than 100 (i.e., 460.8 and 194.4) and another
two of them feature ordered quantities between 51-100 (i.e., 64.8 and 97.2),
whereas the majority of all cases (74%) features ordered quantities up to 50.
in other words, late deliveries may be related to large quantity orders.
with regard to late invoices, there are 148 cases in which invoices are
issued more than two days after corresponding deliveries. we analyzed the
time periods between \delivery item" events and \invoice item" events of these
cases using dotted chart analysis [60] as shown in fig. 13. the analysis showed
that 82.43% of late-invoices cases featured time periods ranging over weekends.

therefore, we subtracted two days from the duration of these cases in order
to obtain the accurate total working days for invoicing. in total, we found 108
cases which took more than two working days for invoicing. among these cases,
73% belong to one particular customer. from these in-depth investigations,
three main insights can be derived. first, the analysis of late deliveries shows
that ordered quantities may be the cause of the delays. second, most of late-
invoice cases occurred during weekends. finally, late invoices usually belong to
the cases of one particular customer. according to our ndings, the company
should further analyze their manufacturing or delivering process especially in
the cases of large ordered quantities for nding the root cause of the delivery
performance. furthermore, they should pay attention to invoicing cases that
span over weekends and further inspect the reason of the late invoices related
to the aforementioned particular customer.
when comparing sellerco's realrevenue gures (as disclosed to us by a
company representative) with the revenue gures from our results based on
edi data, it turns out that only a fraction (between 5% and 50%) of the ac-
tual revenue of the company gets reected in our analysis. this implies that
a signicant portion of real-world business transactions of sellerco is actually
not reected in the sample of edi messages used in this case study, which
is expectable considering that heavily cleaned data was used. moreover, some
business transactions of sellerco may not get reected in edi data at all.
hence, the results of the case study need to be interpreted with care with
regard to their capability of adequately reecting the overall performance of
sellerco. furthermore, information in edi messages is limited to certain kinds
and, hence, some kpis of interest may not be derived from edi data at all.
for instance, in this case study kpis related to the learning and growth per-
spectives of bscs (e.g., number of new products, employee turnover rate, etc.)
as well as some kpis which may directly reect sellerco's business objectives
(e.g., prot, number of customer complaints, etc.) could not be derived.
overall, this case study shows the applicability of the approach to real-
world situations where all steps of the framework could be performed and
its usefulness for gathering business intelligence in the form of process models,
kpis linked to business objectives and the related bsc. these nal results can
be mapped to the real situation of the company. more concretely, the following
conclusions can be drawn: firstly, the employed pam approach proved useful
for preparing an event log that serves for discovering a model that reects
actual \physical" activities (i.e., decoupled from asynchronously interchanged
edi messages) of the inter-organizational business process under examination
(cf. research question 1, section 2.3). secondly, the edimine bsc framework
allowed for the bottom-up denition and calculation of kpis in line with busi-
ness objectives dened in a top-down fashion (research question 2). thirdly,
the edi & business information ontologies allowed for the unied handling of
edi messages of dierent edifact releases varying in syntax and semantics,
and for their consolidation in overarching process models and kpis (research
question 3). finally, the combined application of these contributions led to
concrete insights in a business context, such as factors that promote delays

in the examined business process. however, the results from the case study
also indicate that there is signicant room for improvement with regard to the
congruency of edi-based kpis with the actual business situation of the orga-
nization under analysis. in particular, information from non-edi data sources
is required for the calculation of some types of kpis.
in this article, we identied two shortcomings associated with current us-
age of edi technology in industry. in addressing these shortcomings, we pro-
posed using edi messages directly as a data source for inter-organizational
process mining as well as for business performance analysis. we formulated
three related research questions and discussed the corresponding state of the
art. subsequently, we introduced the edimine framework which comprises
(i) a method for extracting business information from edi messages using se-
mantic technologies, (ii) methods for identifying events and process instances
from edi artifacts and (iii) a framework for calculating kpis from events and
business information originating from edi data. for evaluating the presented
approach, we developed the ediminer toolset as well as the edimine bsc
plug-in for prom 6 and conducted a case study in the context of a real-world
company.
our results show that mining edi messages can provide organizations with
business intelligence for investigating inter-organizational business processes
as they are executed in reality , not as they were merely planned and/or mod-
eled. together with related business information from exchanged edi messages
which is transformed to scores of kpis and business objectives, organizations
are able to evaluate their inter-organizational business performance. this is
in line with the idea of bpm, which aims at the continuous improvement of
business processes by stepping through the bpm life cycle [6]. by means of
the edimine framework, companies are not only able to visualize and docu-
ment their edi-based processes, but also monitor and audit them from both
process and business performance perspectives and based on both historic and
real-time data (e.g., through online process mining; cf. [2, p.241]). according
to the bpm life cycle, the insights gained in the monitoring phase may serve
as input to the next phase covering process optimization. the task of process
optimization and continuous improvement can be considered of special interest
for the eld of edi, where legacy systems are commonly in use.
our future research will concentrate on tackling three current limitations of
the edimine framework. firstly, the current implementation of the edimine
framework as well as the case study presented in this article focus on edifact.
as mentioned earlier, the framework can be adapted to support other inter-
change standards (e.g., xml-based business documents formats). however,
the specic benets of applying our approach in other settings than tradi-
tional edi need yet to be investigated. secondly, the edimine framework is
currently only evaluated by one case study. more cases in dierent context
would provide additional insights and learnings. thirdly, our approach is cur-
rently limited to business transactions supported by and reected in electronic
business documents. however, as discussed in the case study, business transac-
tions of an organization may be enacted as well by dierent means than edi.

65 analyzing inter-organizational business processes 33
we intend to investigate how insights gained from edi data may be integrated
with other data sources, such as operational databases, for fully reecting an
organization's performance. moreover, deriving kpis solely from edi data
is also insucient to cover the measurement of all inter-organizational suc-
cess factors. this is because some success factors (i) require kpis that are
not related to business transactions (e.g., number of new products, employee
turn-over rate, etc.) and (ii) are dicult to measure quantitatively. therefore,
including dierent data sources other than usual business operational data is
necessary for extending performance analysis coverage to additional perspec-
tives. in addition, an extension of the framework towards the integration of
inter- and intra-organizational business processes may facilitate analyses of an
organization's business performance in its entirety.
