abstract. fueled by the omnipresence of event logs in transactional
information systems (cf. wfm, erp, crm, scm, and b2b systems),
process mining has become a vivid research area. until recently, the in-formation in these event logs was rarely used to analyze the underlying
processes. process mining aims at improving this by providing techniques
and tools for discovering process, control, data, organizational, and so-cial structures from event logs, i.e., the basic idea of process mining is
to diagnose business processes by mining event logs for knowledge. in
this position paper we focus on the potential use of process mining formeasuring business alignment, i.e., comparing the real behavior of an
information system or its users with the intended or expected behav-
ior. such a delta analysis may assist in creating and maintaining the ﬁtbetween business processes and supporting information systems.
1 introduction
in many organizations new processes are emerging and existing processes are
changing (“the only contant is change”). therefore, the alignment of business
processes and information systems requires continuous attention. to “maintain
the ﬁt” it is important to detect changes over time, i.e., deviations ofthe de-scribed or prescribed behavior. rare deviations will always happen, but should
not be regarded as a symptom ofa change. however, ifconsiderable amount
ofprocess instances deviate f rom the prescribed pattern, some action should beundertaken to align the business process and the supporting information system.
similarly, to “create the ﬁt” it may be worthwhile to monitor the actual behavior
of the people in the organization before conﬁguring/installing the (new) informa-
tion system. both for creating and maintaining the ﬁt (i.e., securing alignment)
we propose process mining techniques which use event logs to discover the actual
process.
today, many enterprise information systems store relevant events in some
structured form. for example, workﬂow management systems typically registerthe start and completion ofactivities. erp systems like sap log all transactions,
e.g., users ﬁlling out forms, changing documents, etc. business-to-business (b2b)
systems log the exchange ofmessages with other parties. call center packagesbut also general-purpose crm systems log interactions with customers. these
examples show that many systems have some kind of event log often referred to
as “history”, “audit trail”, “transaction log”, etc. [1, 2]. the event log typicallycontains information about events referring to an activity and a case. the case
(also named process instance) is the “thing” which is being handled, e.g., a cus-tomer order, a job application, an insurance claim, a building permit, etc. the
activity (also named task, operation, action, or work-item) is some operation on
the case. typically, events have a timestamp indicating the time ofoccurrence.
moreover, when people are involved, event logs will typically contain informa-
tion on the person executing or initiating the event, i.e., the originator .b a s e d
on this information several tools and techniques for process mining have beendeveloped.
1
process mining is useful for at least two reasons. first of all, it could be used
as a tool to ﬁnd out how people and/or procedures really work. consider forexample processes supported by an erp system like sap (e.g., a procurement
process). such a system logs all transactions but in many cases does not enforce
a speciﬁc way ofworking. in such an environment, process mining could be used
to gain insight in the actual process. another example would be the ﬂow ofpa-
tients in a hospital. note that in such an environment all activities are logged butinformation about the underlying process is typically missing. in this context it
is important to stress that management information systems provide informa-
tion about key performance indicators like resource utilization, ﬂow times, andservice levels but notabout the underlying business processes (e.g., causal rela-
tions, ordering ofactivities, etc.). second, process mining could be used f or delta
analysis , i.e., comparing the actual process with some predeﬁned process. note
that in many situations there is a descriptive or prescriptive process model. such
a model speciﬁes how people and organizations are assumed/expected to work.
by comparing the descriptive or prescriptive process model with the discoveredmodel, discrepancies between both can be detected and used to improve the pro-
cess. consider for example the so-called reference models in the context of sap.
these models describe how the system should be used. using process mining itis possible to verify whether this is the case. in fact, process mining could also
be used to compare diﬀerent departments/organizations using the same erp
system.
the remainder ofthis paper is organized as f ollows. section 2 introduces
the concept ofbusiness process mining f ollowed by a short description ofa case
study in section 3. section 4 brieﬂy discusses process mining as a tool for delta
analysis, i.e., measuring the business alignment by comparing event logs with
descriptive or prescriptive (process) models.
2 business process mining: an overview
the goal of process mining is to extract information about processes from trans-action logs [1]. we assume that it is possible to record events such that (i) eachevent refers to an activity (i.e., a well-deﬁned step in the process), (ii) each event
refers to a case(i.e., a process instance), (iii) each event can have a performer
1in this position paper, we do not provide an overview of related work, instead we
refer to [1, 2] and www.processmining.com.a l s or e fe r r e dt oa s originator (the person executing or initiating the activity),
and (iv) events have a timestamp and are totally ordered. table 1 shows an ex-
ample ofa log involving 19 events, 5 activities, and 6 originators. in addition to
the information shown in this table, some event logs contain more information
on the case itself, i.e., data elements referring to properties of the case. for ex-ample, the case handling systems flower logs every modiﬁcation ofsome data
element.

table 1. an event log.
event logs such as the one shown in table 1 are used as the starting point for
mining. we distinguish three diﬀerent perspectives: (1) the process perspective,
(2) the organizational perspective and (3) the case perspective. the process per-
spective focuses on the control-ﬂow, i.e., the ordering of activities. the goal of
mining this perspective is to ﬁnd a good characterization ofall possible paths,
e.g., expressed in terms ofa petri net or event-driven process chain (epc). theorganizational perspective focuses on the originator ﬁeld, i.e., which performers
are involved and how are they related. the goal is to either structure the or-
ganization by classifying people in terms of roles and organizational units or toshow relation between individual performers (i.e., build a social network). the
case perspective focuses on properties of cases. cases can be characterized by
their path in the process or by the originators working on a case. however, casescan also be characterized by the values ofthe corresponding data elements. for
example, ifa case represent a replenishment order it is interesting to know the
supplier or the number ofproducts ordered.aand

fig. 1. some mining results for the process perspective (a) and organizational (b and
c) perspective based on the event log shown in table 1.
the process perspective is concerned with the “how?” question, the orga-
nizational perspective is concerned with the “who?” question, and the case
perspective is concerned with the “what?” question. to illustrate the ﬁrst two
consider figure 1. the log shown in table 1 contains information about ﬁve
cases (i.e., process instances). the log shows that for four cases (1, 2, 3, and4) the activities a, b, c, and d have been executed. for the ﬁfth case only
three activities are executed: activities a, e, and d. each case starts with the
execution ofa and ends with the execution ofd. ifactivity b is executed, thenalso activity c is executed. however, for some cases activity c is executed be-
fore activity b. based on the information shown in table 1 and by making some
assumptions about the completeness ofthe log (i.e., assuming that the cases arerepresentative and a suﬃcient large subset ofpossible behaviors is observed), we
can deduce the process model shown in figure 1(a). the model is represented
in terms ofa petri net.
figure 1(a) does not show any information about the organization, i.e., it
does not use any information on the people executing activities. however, ta-
ble 1 shows information about the performers. for example, we can deduce thatactivity a is executed by either john or sue, activity b is executed by john,
sue, mike or carol, c is executed by john, sue, mike or carol, d is executed by
pete or clare, and e is executed by clare. we could indicate this information infigure 1(a). the information could also be used to “guess” or “discover” organi-
zational structures. for example, a guess could be that there are three roles: x,
y, and z. for the execution ofa role x is required and john and sue have thisrole. for the execution ofb and c role y is required and john, sue, mike and
carol have this role. for the execution ofd and e role z is required and peteand clare have this role. for ﬁve cases these choices may seem arbitrary but for
larger data sets such inferences capture the dominant roles in an organization.
the resulting “activity-role-performer diagram” is shown in figure 1(b). thethree “discovered” roles link activities to performers. figure 1(c) shows another
view on the organization based on the transfer of work from one individual to
another, i.e., not focus on the relation between the process and individuals buton relations among individuals (or groups ofindividuals). consider f or example
table 1. although carol and mike can execute the same activities (b and c),
mike is always working with john (cases 1 and 2) and carol is always workingwith sue (cases 3 and 4). probably carol and mike have the same role but based
on the small sample shown in table 1 it seems that john is not working with
carol and sue is not working with carol. these examples show that the event
log can be used to derive relations between performers of activities, thus result-
ing in a sociogram. for example, it is possible to generate a sociogram based onthe transfers of work from one individual to another as is shown in figure 1(c).
besides the “how?” and “who?” question (i.e., the process and organization
perspectives), there is the case perspective that is concerned with the “what?”
question. figure 1 does not address this. in fact, focusing on the case perspec-
tive is most interesting when also data elements are logged but these are not
listed in table 1. the case perspective looks at the case as a whole and tries toestablish relations between the various properties ofa case. note that some of
the properties may refer to the activities being executed, the performers working
on the case, and the values ofvarious data elements linked to the case. usingclustering algorithms it would for example be possible two show a positive corre-
lation between the the size ofan order or its handling time and the involvement
ofspeciﬁc people.
orthogonal to the three perspectives (process, organization, and case), the
result ofa mining eﬀort may ref er to logical issues and/or performance issues.
for example, process mining can focus on the logical structure of the processmodel (e.g., the petri net shown in figure 1(a)) or on performance issues such
as ﬂow time. for mining the organizational perspectives, the emphasis can be
on the roles or the social network (cf. figure 1(b) and (c)) or on the utilizationof performers or execution frequencies.
to address the three perspectives and the logical and performance issues we
have developed a set oftools including (e.g., emit , thumb , and minson)sharing a common xml format (see http://www.processmining.org for more
details).
3 case study
we have applied our mining techniques in several organizations. in this section,
we brieﬂy show some results for one of these organizations, i.e., the processes offig. 2. a fragment of the log of a dutch governmental institution responsible for ﬁne-
collection and the corresponding process mining result.
a dutch governmental institution responsible for ﬁne-collection.2a case (pro-
cess instance) is a ﬁne that has to be paid. there may be more ﬁnes related
with the same person. however, each ﬁne corresponds to an independent case.this process has the particularity that as soon as the ﬁne is paid, the process
stops. in total there are 99 distinct activities which can be either manually or
automatically executed. we selected the ﬁnes information for 130136 cases. weconstructed the process log and we applied to this log our process discovery
method that can handle noisy data [3, 4].
figure 2 (top-left) shows a fragment of the log containing 130136 cases. this
log is generated by an information system speciﬁcally constructed for the dutch
governmental institution. (the institution has been in the process ofusing stan-
dard workﬂow technology but this process has been put “on hold”.) the top-right screen shows a screenshot ofour mining tool emit while analyzing the log.

valuable support.ofthe process mining techniques. the discovered models have been inspected
by the domain experts. they concluded that our discovered models were ableto grasp the important aspects ofthe process. moreover, the discovered models
revealed aspects that are often questioned when discussing the process model.
these experiences showed that process discovery can provide useful insights intothe current practice ofa process and highlight diﬀerence between the actual
process and the prescriptive/descriptive model [4].
we have also applied our process mining techniques to a health-care pro-
cess where the ﬂow ofmulti-disciplinary patients is analyzed. we have analyzed
event logs (visits to diﬀerent specialists) ofpatients with peripheral arterial vas-
cular diseases ofthe elizabeth hospital in tilburg and the academic hospitalin maastricht. patients with peripheral arterial vascular diseases are a typical
example ofmulti-disciplinary patients. we have preliminary results showing that
process mining is very diﬃcult given the “spaghetti-like” nature ofthis process.only by focusing on speciﬁc tasks and abstracting from infrequent tasks we are
able to successfully mine such processes. given this experience we are now fo-
cussing on processes have more structure. for example, environments using casehandling system like flower (the workﬂow product ofpallas athena), e.g., the
employee insurance implementing body (uitvoering werknemersverzekeringen,
or uvw).
4 delta analysis
process mining can be used for delta analysis , i.e., comparing the actual process
with some predeﬁned process representing the information system. note that
in many situations there is a descriptive orprescriptive process model. such a
model speciﬁes how people and organizations are assumed/expected to work.
by comparing the descriptive or prescriptive process model with the discovered
model, discrepancies between both can be detected and used to improve theprocess.
as an example consider the so-called reference models in the context of
sap. these models, typically expressed in terms ofevent-driven process chains
(epc), describe how the system should be used. however, in practise people
may use the system diﬀerently or only use a subset ofthe system.
consider for example the two epcs shown in figure 3. the left epc rep-
resents the full process, the right epc shows the parts that are actually beingused. note that tools like the sap reverse business engineer (rbe) can be used
to monitor how frequent parts of the sap system are being used. unfortunately,
tools like rbe do not consider the order ofactivities nor other aspects such asthe organizational and case perspective.
for the fifth workshop on business process modeling, development, and
support (bpmds’04) with the theme “creating and maintaining the ﬁt betweenbusiness processes and support systems”, we would like to discuss the following
statement: “process mining can be used to improve the ﬁt between business
processes and information systems”. in other words: a delta analysis based on
