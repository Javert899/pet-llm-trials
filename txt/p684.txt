abstract there seems to be a never ending stream of new process mod-
eling notations. some of these notations are foundational and have been
around for decades (e.g., petri nets). other notations are vendor specic,
incremental, or are only popular for a short while. discussions on the var-
ious competing notations concealed the more important question \what
makes a good process model?" . fortunately, large scale experiences with
process mining allow us to address this question. process mining techniques
can be used to extract knowledge from event data, discover models, align
logs and models, measure conformance, diagnose bottlenecks, and predict
future events. today's processes leave many trails in data bases, audit trails,
message logs, transaction logs, etc. therefore, it makes sense to relate these
event data to process models independent of their particular notation. pro-
cess models discovered based on the actual behavior tend to be very dierent
from the process models made by humans. moreover, conformance checking
techniques often reveal important deviations between models and reality.
the lessons that can be learned from process mining shed a new light on
process model quality. this paper discusses the role of process models and
lists seven problems related to process modeling. based on our experiences
in over 100 process mining projects, we discuss these problems. moreover,
we show that these problems can be addressed by exposing process models
and modelers to event data.

1 introduction
today there exists a wide variety of process modeling notations. some no-
tations have been around for decades. other notations have been proposed2 w.m.p. van der aalst
more recently. notations range from languages aiming to provide a formal
basis (e.g., nite state machines, petri nets, and process algebras) to vendor
specic notations (e.g., the dierent workow languages used by bpm ven-
dors). industry standards such as bpel [10] and bpmn [18] are typically
only partially adopted; vendors support just subsets of these standards and
users tend to use only a tiny fraction of the concepts oered [17]. obviously,
there is little consensus on the modeling language to be used. this resulted
in the \tower of babel of process languages": a plethora of similar but sub-
tly dierent languages inhibiting eective and unied process support and
analysis. this \tower of babel" and the corresponding discussions obfus-
cated more foundational questions related to the correspondence of a model
and reality and the usefulness and quality of process models . therefore, this
paper aims to answer the question: \what makes a good process model?" .
it would be presumptuous to suggest that this paper provides a conclusive
answer to this question. we merely report on our experiences with process
mining thereby stimulating the reader to view the topic from a new angle.
process mining is an emerging research area combining techniques from
process modeling, model-based analysis, data mining, and machine learning.
the goal is to extract knowledge about processes from event data stored in
databases, transaction logs, message logs, etc. process mining techniques are
commonly classied into: (a) discovery , (b) conformance , and (c) enhance-
ment [3]. the rst type of process mining is discovery . a discovery technique
takes an event log and produces a model without using any a-priori infor-
mation. an example is the -algorithm [3,8] that is able to discover a petri
net based on sequences of events. the second type of process mining is con-
formance . here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of
the same process. conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as
recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa [3,21]. the third
type of process mining is enhancement . here, the idea is to extend or im-
prove an existing process model using information about the actual process
recorded in some event log [3]. whereas conformance checking measures
the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining
aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. one type of enhancement
isrepair , i.e., modifying the model to better reect reality. another type
of enhancement is extension , i.e., adding a new perspective to the process
model by cross-correlating it with the log. an example is the extension of
a process model with performance data. for instance, by using timestamps
in the event log it is possible to identify bottlenecks in a process.
over the last decade, process mining emerged as a new discipline [3,
15]. recently, the ieee task force on process mining released the process
mining manifesto [15]. this manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and
77 process mining experts contributed to it. the active participation from
end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrate the
growing signicance of process mining as a bridge between data mining and
business process modeling. in fact, there is a growing number of commer-
cially available software products oering process mining capabilities. somewhat makes a good process model? 3
of these products embed process mining functionality in a larger system,
e.g., pallas athena embeds process mining in their bpm suite bpm jone.
other products aim at simplifying process mining using an intuitive user
interface (disco, reect, interstage bpme, processanalyzer, aris ppm,
etc.). next to these commercial systems, there is the open-source prom
framework ( www.processmining.org ). prom has become the de facto stan-
dard for process mining in the scientic community and ideas developed in
the context of prom have been adopted in commercial systems. in terms
of process mining functionality, the scope of prom { with its hundreds of
plug-ins developed by research groups all over the globe { is much broader
than any other \business intelligence" tool.
we have applied prom in over 100 organizations, e.g., in the context
of joint research projects, master projects, and consultancy projects. this
provided us with a refreshing view on process models:
{process mining allows for the discovery of process models based on facts .
often the real process has surprising \features" that the stakeholders are
not aware of (e.g., exceptional paths or skipped activities).
{given a pre-existing model and an event log, conformance analysis can be
used to detect dierences between reality and model . often, such analysis
immediately reveals that the process model provides an oversimplied
or simply incorrect view on reality. such diagnostics can be used to
align models and reality, thus improving the accuracy and usefulness of
models.
{process mining establishes an explicit connection between elements in
the process model and events observed in reality. this way it is possible
tobreathe life into otherwise static models . as a result, process mod-
els will not end up in some archive without anyone looking at them.
connecting models and event logs will stimulate the active/daily use of
process models. however, such use of process models also imposes new
requirements.
{the automatic generation of process models and the projection of event
logs and running cases on these models, shows that it does not make
any sense to aim at a creating a single process model. for the process
of interest, one would like to generate dierent models depending on
the questions one would like to answer . process models should be like
geographic maps; there may be dierent maps covering the same area
(hiking map, cycling map, highway map, city map, etc.).
in this paper, we report on the main lessons that can be learned from
process mining. in section 2, we briey introduce process mining. based
on this, we discuss the role of process models (section 3). section 4 dis-
cusses seven typical problems related to process modeling. these summa-
rize generic lessons learned through our experiences with process mining. to
conclude, section 5 discusses how event logs can breathe life into otherwise
static process models.4 w.m.p. van der aalst
2 process mining: an example
starting point for process mining is a so-called event log . an event log con-
tains information on process instances , often referred to as cases . each case
is described by a sequence of events also called trace. let us start with the
simple case where each event is completely described by the correspond-
ing activity name. table 1 shows a small event log taken from [3]. in such
an abstract description of an event log, each case is represented by a se-
quence of activities. for clarity the activity names have been transformed
into single-letter labels, e.g., adenotes activity register request .

process mining algorithms for process discovery can transform the in-
formation shown in table 1 into process models. for instance, the basic
-algorithm [8] discovers the petri net shown in fig. 1. it is easy to check
that all six traces in table 1 are possible in the model. let us replay the
trace of the rst case { ha;b;d;e;hi{ to show that the trace \ts" (i.e.,
conforms to) the model. in the initial marking shown in fig. 1, transition
ais indeed enabled because of the token in start. recall that a transition
in a petri net is enabled when each input place contains a token, i.e., all
input places are marked. enabled transitions can rethereby removing a
token from each input place and producing a token for each output place.
after ring the enabled transition athe places c1and c2are marked, i.e.,
both places contain a token. transition bis enabled at this marking and its
execution results in the marking with tokens in c2andc3. now we have exe-
cutedha;biand the sequence hd;e;hiremains. the transition corresponding
to the next event in the trace, i.e. d, is indeed enabled and its execution
results in the marking enabling e(tokens in places c3and c4). firinge
results in the marking with one token in c5. this marking enables the nal
eventhin the trace. after executing h, the case ends in the desired nal
marking with just a token in place end. similarly, it can be checked that thewhat makes a good process model? 5
other ve traces shown in table 1 are also possible in the model and that
all of these traces result in the marking with just a token in place end.

fig. 1 the process model discovered by the -algorithm [8] based on the event
log in table 1
the petri net shown in fig. 1 also allows for traces not present in table 1.
for example, the traces ha;d;c;e;f;b;d;e;g iandha;c;d;e;f;c;d;e;f;c;d;e;
f;c;d;e;f; b;d;e;g iare also possible. this is a desired phenomenon as the
goal is notto represent just the particular set of example traces in the event
log. process mining techniques look for the most likely model explaining the
underlying process. therefore, process discovery algorithms need to gener-
alize the behavior contained in the log to show the most likely underlying
model that is not invalidated by the next set of observations. one of the
challenges of process mining is to balance between \overtting" (the model
is too specic and only allows for the \accidental behavior" observed) and
\undertting" (the model is too general and allows for behavior unrelated
to the behavior observed).
the-algorithm is just one of many possible process discovery algo-
rithms. for real-life logs more advanced algorithms are needed to better
balance between \overtting" and \undertting" and to deal with \incom-
pleteness" (i.e., logs containing only a small fraction of the possible behavior
due to the large number of alternatives) and \noise" (i.e., a log containing
exceptional/infrequent behavior that should not automatically be incorpo-
rated in the model).
process mining is not limited to process discovery. event logs can be
used to check conformance and enhance existing models. moreover, dier-
ent perspectives may be taken into account. to illustrate this, let us rst
consider the event log shown in table 2. the rst six cases are as before. it is
easy to see that case 7 with trace ha;b;e;giis not possible according to the
model in fig. 1. the model requires the execution of dbeforee, butddid
not occur. this means that the ticket was not checked at all before making6 w.m.p. van der aalst

a decision and paying compensation. conformance checking techniques aim
at discovering such discrepancies [4,21]. a so-called alignment showing the
problem is:
1=abeg
abdeg
the top row of an alignment corresponds to \moves in the log" and the
bottom row corresponds to \moves in the model". if a move in the log
cannot be mimicked by a move in the model, then a \ " (\no move")
appears in the bottom row. if a move in the model cannot be mimicked by
a move in the log, then a \ " (\no move") appears in the top row. for
example, in 1the log did not do a dmove whereas the model has to make
this move to enable e. given a trace in the event log there may be many
possible alignments. the goal is to nd the alignment with the least number
ofelements. the number of elements can be used to quantify tness
[4]. when checking the conformance of the remainder of the event log it can
also be noted that cases 8 and 10 do not conform either. case 9 conforms
although it is not identical to one of the earlier traces. trace ha;b;c;d;e;gi
(i.e. case 8) has the problem that two examinations ( bandc) took place
whereas the model allows for only one. alignment 2shows that the second
examination in the log cannot be mimicked by a move in the model:
2=abcdeg
abdeg
traceha;c;d;e;f;c;b;d;g i(case 10) has two problems as shown by align-
ment3.
3=acdefcbdg
acdefcdeg
note that conformance can be viewed from two angles: (a) the model
does not capture the real behavior (\the model is wrong") and (b) reality
deviates from the desired model (\the event log is wrong"). the rst view-
point is taken when the model is supposed to be descriptive , i.e., capture orwhat makes a good process model? 7
predict reality. the second viewpoint is taken when the model is normative ,
i.e., used to inuence or control reality.
table 1 provides a rather simplistic view on event logs. most event logs
also contain information on resources, timestamps and characteristics of
cases. for example, the rst event of case 1 corresponds to the execution
of activity register request . the real event log may show that this activity
was executed by pete on december 30th 2010. the log may also contain
transactional information showing that the activity was started at noon and
took 30 minutes. characteristics of the request may include customer type,
claimed amount, and execution costs. depending on the type of event, there
can be various attributes. such information can be used to discover other
perspectives, check the conformance of models that are not pure control-ow
models, and to extend models with additional information. for example,
one could derive a social network based on the interaction patterns between
individuals. the social network can be based on the \handover of work"
metric, i.e., the more frequent individual xperformed an activity that is
causally followed by an activity performed by individual y, the stronger the
relation between xandyis [7].
figure 2 illustrates the way in which a control-ow oriented model can
be extended. process mining may reveal that sara is the only one perform-
ing the activities decide and reinitiate request. this suggests that there is
a \manager role" and that sara is the only one having this role. activ-
ityexamine thoroughly is performed only by sue and sean. this suggests
some \expert role" associated to this activity. the remaining activities are
performed by pete, mike and ellen. this suggests some \assistant role"
as shown in fig. 2. techniques for organizational process mining [22] can
discover such organizational structures and relate activities to resources
through roles. by exploiting resource information in the log, the organiza-
tional perspective can be added to the process model. similarly, information
on timestamps and frequencies can be used to add performance related in-
formation to the model. figure 2 sketches that it is possible to measure the
time that passes between an examination (activity borc) and the actual
decision (activity e). if this time is remarkably long, process mining can be
used to identify the problem and discover possible causes. if the event log
contains case-related information, this can be used to further analyze the
decision points in the process. for instance, through decision-point analysis
it may be learned that requests for compensation of more than e800 tend
to be rejected.
using process mining, the dierent perspectives can be cross-correlated
to nd surprising insights. examples of such ndings could be: \requests
examined by sean tend to be rejected more frequently", \requests for which
the ticket is checked after examination tend to take much longer", \requests
of less than e500 tend to be completed without any additional iterations".
moreover, these perspectives can also be linked to conformance questions.
for example, it may be shown that pete is involved in relatively many
incorrectly handled requests.8 w.m.p. van der aalst

using a small event log, this section introduced the topic of process min-
ing. unlike conventional process modeling and analysis approaches, there is
a direct link between model and reality recorded in the form of an event
log.
the event log shown in table 1 and the corresponding process model in
fig. 2 provide an oversimplied view of process mining. there is a contin-
uum of processes ranging from highly structured processes (often referred to
aslasagna processes) to unstructured processes ( spaghetti processes). an
example of a spaghetti process is shown in fig. 3. the model was obtained
using the heuristic miner with default settings. note that some low frequent
behavior has already been ltered out, i.e., the real process is even more
spaghetti-like than the model shown in fig. 3. this illustrates the challenges
related to process mining when applied to less structured processes.
process models such as the one depicted in fig. 3 provide a \real-
ity check" for business consultants, process analysts, and it developers.what makes a good process model? 9

fig. 3 spaghetti process describing the diagnosis and treatment of 2765 patients
in a dutch hospital [3]. the process model was constructed based on an event log
containing 114,592 events. there are 619 dierent activities (taking event types
into account) executed by 266 dierent individuals (doctors, nurses, etc.)
we have developed various techniques to simplify such models and extract
meaningful knowledge from them. in fact, it radically changed our under-
standing of process modeling and process models.
3 play-in, play-out, and replay
one of the key elements of process mining is the emphasis on establishing
a strong relation between a process model and \reality" captured in the
form of an event log [3]. inspired by the terminology used by david harel
in the context of live sequence charts [13], we use the terms play-in ,play-
out, and replay to reect on this relation. figure 4 illustrates these three
notions.
play-out refers to the classical use of process models. for example, given
a petri net or bpmn model, it is possible to generate behavior. the traces
in table 1 could have been obtained by repeatedly \playing the token game"
using the petri net of fig. 1. play-out can be used both for the analysis
and the enactment of business processes. a workow engine can be seen
as a \play-out engine" that controls cases by only allowing the \moves"
possible according to the model. hence, play-out can be used to enact op-
erational processes using some executable model. simulation tools also use
a play-out engine to conduct experiments. the main idea of simulation is
to repeatedly run a model and thus collect statistics and condence inter-
vals. note that a simulation engine is similar to a workow engine. the
main dierence is that the simulation engine interacts with a modeled en-
vironment whereas the workow engine interacts with the real environment
(workers, customers, etc.). also classical verication approaches using ex-
haustive state-space analysis { often referred to as model checking [12] {
can be seen as play-out methods.10 w.m.p. van der aalst

fig. 4 three ways of relating event logs (or other sources of information contain-
ing example behavior) and process models: play-in ,play-out , and replay
play-in is the opposite of play-out, i.e., example behavior is taken as
input and the goal is to construct a model. play-in is often referred to as
inference . the-algorithm and other process discovery approaches are ex-
amples of play-in techniques. note that the petri net of fig. 1 can be derived
automatically given an event log like the one in table 1. most data mining
techniques use play-in, i.e., a model is learned on the basis of examples.
however, traditionally, data mining has not been concerned with process
models [3]. typical examples of models that are considered by data mining
techniques are decision trees (\people that drink more than ve glasses of
alcohol and smoke more than 56 cigarettes tend to die young") and associ-
ation rules (\people that buy diapers also buy beer") [23]. unfortunately, it
is not possible to use conventional data mining techniques to play-in pro-
cess models. only recently, process mining techniques have become readily
available to discover process models based on event logs.what makes a good process model? 11
replay uses an event log anda process model as input. the event log is
\replayed" on top of the process model. as shown earlier, it is possible to
replay traceha;b;d;e;hion the petri net in fig. 1; simply \play the token
game" by forcing the transitions to re (if possible) in the order indicated.
an event log may be replayed for dierent purposes:
{conformance checking : discrepancies between the log and the model can
be detected and quantied by replaying the log. for instance, replaying
traceha;b;e;hion the petri net in fig. 1 will show that dshould have
happened but did not (cf. alignment 1withgreplaced by h).
{extending the model with frequencies and temporal information. by re-
playing the log one can see which parts of the model are visited fre-
quently. replay can also be used to detect bottlenecks. consider, for
example, the trace ha8;b9;d20;e21;h21iin which the superscripts denote
timestamps. by replaying the trace on top of fig. 1 one can see that
ewas enabled at time 20 and occurred at time 21. the enabling of e
was delayed by the time it took to complete d; althoughdwas enabled
already at time 8, it occurred only at time 20.
{constructing predictive models. by replaying event logs one can build
predictive models, i.e., for the dierent states of the model particular
predictions can be made. for example, a predictive model learned by
replaying many cases could show that the expected time until completion
after enabling eis eight hours.
{operational support. replay is not limited to historic event data. one
can also replay partial traces of cases still running. this can be used
for detecting deviations at run-time, e.g., the partial trace ha8;e11iof a
case that is still running will never t into fig. 1. hence, an alert can be
generated before the case completes. similarly, it is possible to predict
the remaining processing time or the likelihood of being rejected of a
case having a partial trace, e.g., a partial executed case ha8;b9ihas an
expected remaining processing time of 3 :5 days and a 40 percent proba-
bility of being rejected. such predictions can also be used to recommend
suitable next steps to progress the case.
until recently, the focus of process analysis was mostly on modeled pro-
cesses rather than factual data. however, practical experiences with play-in
and replay shed new light on the quality of process models. the next section
summarizes some of the lessons learned.
clearly, process mining is only possible if it is possible to obtain enough
high-quality event data. events may be stored in database tables, message
logs, mail archives, transaction logs, and other data sources. more impor-
tant than the storage format, is the quality of such event logs. the quality
of a process mining result heavily depends on the input. therefore, event
logs should be treated as rst-class citizens in the information systems sup-
porting the processes to be analyzed. unfortunately, event logs are often
merely a \by-product" used for debugging or proling. moreover, as event
logs contain only sample behavior, they should not be assumed to be com-12 w.m.p. van der aalst
plete. process mining techniques need to deal with incompleteness by using
an \open world assumption": the fact that something did not happen does
not imply that it cannot happen. this makes it challenging to deal with
small event logs with a lot of variability. despite these challenges it is obvi-
ous that there is an exponential growth of event data and that the quality
of event data continue to improve as it systems become more pervasive.
4 seven problems related to process modeling
as indicated earlier, we have applied process mining (in particular our pro-
cess mining tool prom) in more than 100 organizations [3]. this changed
the way we view models and provides useful input for answering the ques-
tion \what makes a good process model?" . in particular, we noted typical
limitations of process models and errors frequently made when modeling a
process. in the remainder, we identify some root causes for the ineective-
ness or futility of many business process models based on insights obtained
through process mining.
4.1 first problem: aiming for one model that suits all purposes
often modelers aim to create one \perfect process model" that needs to
serve all possible purposes. however, a process model is merely a view on
the process. depending on the questions that need to be answered, dierent
views may be needed. nevertheless, designers often look for a kind of \holy
grail", i.e., the process model that can be used to answer all questions.
obviously, such a model does not exist.
when discovering process models on the basis of event logs, it becomes
evident that process models should be seen as maps (cf. figure 5). there
may be highway maps, city maps, bicycle maps, boating maps, and hiking
maps covering (parts of) the same area. some elements may not be shown
while other elements are emphasized. some maps may show a larger area
with less detail (cf. figure 5(a)) whereas other maps show a smaller area
with more details (cf. figure 5(b)). when cycling another map is desired
showing the bicycle paths (cf. figure 5(c)). similarly, depending on the in-
tended purpose (discussion, bottleneck analysis, auditing, simulation, etc.),
dierent process models are needed. therefore, one should not focus on the
quality of single maps but concentrate on the ability to generate dierent
maps that suit specic purposes.
4.2 second problem: straitjacketing smaller interacting processes into one
monolithic model
existing business process modeling notations such as bpmn, bpel, uml
activity diagrams, yawl and wf-nets, are mostly used to describe thewhat makes a good process model? 13
(a) map of brisbane (zoomed-out) (b) map of brisbane (zoomed-in)
(c) bicycle map showing bicycle paths(d) map showing real-estate for sale
(e) map showing traffic 
jams (red roads are 
congested, green 
roads show flowing 
traffic)
fig. 5 process models can be viewed as maps. for the same process there may
be multiple maps (depending on the desired level of detail and use). moreover,
information may be projected on such maps thus \breathing life" into otherwise
static/abstract views on reality
life-cycle of one process instance in isolation. we refer to such models as
monolithic . note that a monolithic model may be hierarchical, i.e., activities
at one level are decomposed into subprocesses. however, all activities at all
the dierent levels refer to status changes of the same process instance.
of course a process may be instantiated multiple times, but the interaction
between instances (other than the competition for resources) is not modeled.14 w.m.p. van der aalst
monolithic process models are typically unable to adequately capture real-
life processes

fig. 6 class diagram showing the relations between orders, order lines, and de-
liveries
to illustrate the problem consider the class diagram in shown in fig. 6.
orders consist of one or more orderlines. an order may be decomposed into
multiple deliveries and a delivery may be composed of orderlines originating
from dierent orders of the same customer. for example, a customer places
an order for three books. one week later, she places an order for two more
books. of the books ordered initially, only two can be delivered immedi-
ately. the book that could not be delivered in the rst week is delivered
together with the two books ordered in the second week. this shows that
there is a many-to-many relationship between orders and deliveries. there
are dierent types of events not shown in fig. 6. for example, \customer
places an order", \customer pays for the order", \availability of orderline
is checked", \delivery is shipped", etc. it is relatively easy to model the
life-cycles of orders, orderlines, and deliveries in separate diagrams. how-
ever, mainstream notations do not allow for the modeling of the interactions
between these individual life-cycles. for example, in bpmn one needs to
straitjacket things into one diagram modeling a single instance in isolation.
of course a bpmn diagram describes a process at the type level, i.e., the
process may be instantiated for many instances. however, interactions be-
tween instances are not modeled. (note that we are not referring to message
ows connecting dierent pools in bpmn [18].) modern workow languages
like yawl support so-called \multiple instance tasks". this allows for the
embedding of \smaller instances" (e.g., orderlines) into \larger instances"
(e.g., orders). however, this does not solve the problem of faithfully model-
ing the many-to-many relationship between orders and deliveries. the rst
workow language not forcing the designer to straitjacket smaller interacting
processes into one monolithic model was the proclets language [5]. recently,
such notations gained more attention and are now commonly referred to as
\artifact centric" [9].
the problem just described surfaces when applying process mining tech-
niques to end-to-end processes using data from systems such as sap, oracle,what makes a good process model? 15
and peoplesoft [3]. nevertheless, process modelers try to squeeze such pro-
cesses into a monolithic model. a nice example can be found in sap's ref-
erence model which describes more than 600 standard processes supported
by the sap system [16]. one of these processes deals with the handling of
job applications and the management of open positions. in sap's process
model some of the activities deal with a single job application whereas oth-
ers deal with a single open position. this is put together in a single model
where both types of activities are connected, i.e., job and position instances
are mixed up. obviously, this does not make any sense, e.g., there may be
many applications for the same position that all need to be dealt with con-
currently. this is a common mistake; good models do not mix-up dierent
types of instances.
4.3 third problem: using static hierarchical decomposition as the only
abstraction mechanism
most process modeling notations support some notion of hierarchy. in prin-
ciple, such hierarchy concepts are useful. the designer can hide details at
lower levels. however, often the hierarchy is static and static decomposition
is the only way of abstraction. the distribution of activities over the various
levels in the hierarchy cannot be varied and low-level connections surface
at higher levels.
we explain this problem using the metamorphic relation between pro-
cesses and maps mentioned earlier. consider for example the zooming func-
tionality of google maps. note that, while zooming out, insignicant things
are either left out or dynamically clustered into aggregate shapes (e.g.,
streets and suburbs amalgamate into cities). see figure 5(a)-(b) as an illus-
tration. note that hierarchical decomposition cannot be used to relate both
maps. important roads (e.g., highways) may be visible at all levels whereas
insignicant roads disappear or amalgamate into suburbs.
navigation systems and applications such as google maps provide such
a seamless zoom. traditionally, process models are static, e.g., it is impos-
sible to seamlessly zoom in to see part of the process in more detail. to
deal with larger processes, typically a static hierarchical decomposition is
used. in such a hierarchy, a process is composed of subprocesses, and in
turn these subprocesses may be composed of smaller subprocesses. how-
ever, despite the hierarchy the \true level of detail" is constant for all levels .
activities in two dierent subprocesses can only be connected if there is a
connection at the higher level. therefore, one cannot abstract from details
at higher levels, i.e., details are encapsulated but not removed. from a sys-
tem's design perspective this can be justied easily. however, when the goal
is to make understandable models, a single static hierarchical decomposition
is insucient. the hierarchy should be dynamic and the model presented
should, if desired, also leave out things less relevant. note that a geographic
map may leave out many details that become only visible when zooming in.16 w.m.p. van der aalst
the fact that there is no highway connecting two cities does not imply that
there cannot be a dirt road connecting these cities. yet, static hierarchical
decomposition forces the designer to implicitly show the dirt road at all
levels. metaphorically speaking: the dirt road needs to be hidden under a
\virtual highway" at the higher level.
note that this problem is related to the rst problem identied (sec-
tion 4.1). classically, a model supports just one abstraction level. we ad-
vocate support for varying abstraction levels (seamless zoom and selection
capabilities).
4.4 fourth problem: modeling humans as if they are machines doing a
single task
process modeling is not limited to control-ow, e.g., when making a sim-
ulation model it is vital to also model resources. however, the resource
perspective is often modeled in a rather shallow manner, e.g., tasks and
resource are just connected through roles. although simple mathematical
models may suce to model machines or people working in an assembly
line, they are inadequate when modeling people involved in multiple pro-
cesses and exposed to multiple priorities [2,6]. a worker who is involved in
multiple processes needs to distribute his attention over these. this makes
it dicult to model one process in isolation. workers also do not work
at constant speed. figure 7 visualizes the so-called \yerkes-dodson law of
arousal" that describes the relation between workload and performance of
people [2,24]. in most processes one can easily observe that people typically
take more time to complete a task and eectively work fewer hours per day
if there is hardly any work to do. unfortunately, such phenomena are sel-
dom modeled thus making process models incomplete. for example, most
simulation models involving human actors distributing their attention over
multiple processes are unable to correctly predict response times and ow
times.

fig. 7 yerkes-dodson law of arousalwhat makes a good process model? 17
through process mining one can easily observe that people behave dif-
ferent from machines. for example, it may be that long waiting times are
caused by workers spending just a few hours per month on the process (e.g.,
a manager that needs to approve each request formally). moreover, yerkes-
dodson law of arousal can be observed in many processes where both the
start and completion times of activities are recorded.
4.5 fifth problem: being vague about vagueness
in large organizations, process models often serve as the interface between
\it" and \business". it developers and system analysts prefer detailed
and relatively precise models without any consideration for business as-
pects whereas domain experts and managers prefer informal models focus-
ing on non-technical business-related aspects. as a result, the audience for
a particular process model can be rather diverse. this creates all kinds of
interpretation problems where one group associates more meaning to parts
of the model than others. the solution is not to remove all ambiguity by
enforcing the use of formal specications; there is a clear need for vagueness
to make models comprehensible [14]. unfortunately, most process models
do not show whether parts of it are vague or not.
consider for example bpmn and the empirical study presented in [17].
the bpmn language oers many constructs, but most users understand
and use only a small subset. an expert may read a bpmn model as if it
was an executable workow model, whereas a domain expert may view the
model as just a powerpoint diagram without any formal meaning. in other
words: most models are \vague about vagueness".
process mining can be used to get grip on the explicit representation
of vagueness. we often aim at creating a model that explains 100% of the
observed behavior. however, one can also aim at creating a so-called \80/20
model", i.e., the process model describes 80% of the behavior seen in the
log. this model is typically relatively simple because often the remaining
20% of the log account for 80% of the variability in the process. consider
for example the process model shown fig. 3. this model can be simplied
dramatically by focusing on the most frequent activities and/or by leaving
out less frequent paths.
labeling a process model as an \80/20 model", \90/20 model" or \70/25
model" makes vagueness explicit and allows people to focus on the main-
stream behavior. moreover, using conformance checking one can indicate
where the simplied model deviates from reality, i.e., vagueness can be quan-
tied and located.
4.6 sixth problem: abstracting from the things that really matter
process model notations tend to focus on the \process logic", i.e., the or-
dering of activities. some notations also allow for the modeling of other18 w.m.p. van der aalst
perspectives such as the resource perspective (e.g., showing roles) and the
data perspective (e.g., conditions on arcs). however, these are all design-
oriented features and not necessarily the things that matter most to the
person looking at the model. costs, frequencies, utilization, and other per-
formance related metrics are of the utmost importance for process models
but rarely shown. some authors distinguish between functional (process
logic, work distribution, etc.) and non-functional (costs, response times,
frequencies, quality) elements. the focus of most process models is on func-
tional elements thereby neglecting non-functional aspects. in fact, we argue
that lion's share of models abstract from the aspects that matter most.
to illustrate this viewpoint, let us consider the notion of concept drift
identied in the context of process mining [11]. the term concept drift refers
to the situation in which the process is changing while being analyzed. for
instance, in the beginning of the event log two activities may be concurrent
whereas later in the log these activities become sequential. there may also
be seasonal inuences causing long waiting times in particular periods. the
arrival process of new process instances or the availability of resources may
uctuate. such phenomena are seldom shown in process models. yet, these
\second-order dynamics" are important for most stakeholders.
process models should show what matters most. however, when looking
at notations such as bpmn, the focus seems to be on things that are less
relevant.
4.7 seventh problem: color, size and location without meaning
as indicated before, process models can be viewed as maps. in section 4.3,
we showed that, by zooming out, less relevant details are abstracted from.
however, cartographers not only eliminate irrelevant details, but also use
colors to highlight important features. for instance, a map may empha-
size the importance of highways using the color red. moreover, graphical
elements have a particular size to indicate their signicance, e.g., the sizes
of lines and dots may vary. for instance, the size of a city name is pro-
portional to the number of citizens. geographical maps also have a clear
interpretation of the x-axis and y-axis, i.e., the layout of a map is not arbi-
trary as the coordinates of elements have a meaning. all of this is in stark
contrast with mainstream process models. the x-axis and y-axis of a pro-
cess model have no meaning, e.g., the layout does not add any information.
although modeling tools allow for using colors, the color typically has no
semantics. the dierent types of model elements (e.g., activities, gateways,
events, connectors, and places) typically have a default color. moreover, the
size of a model element also has no semantics. typically all elements of a
particular type have the same size. because size, color, and layout are not
employed when creating process maps, the result is less intuitive and less
informative. however, ideas from cartography can easily be incorporated in
the construction of business process maps. some examples:what makes a good process model? 19
{the sizeof an activity can reect its frequency or some other property
indicating its signicance (e.g., costs or resource use).
{the color of an activity can reect the mean service time of the activity.
for example, activities that take longer than average are colored red
whereas short running activities are colored green.
{the width of an arc can reect the importance of the corresponding
causal dependency.
{the coloring of arcs can be used to highlight bottlenecks.
{the positioning of activities can have a well-dened meaning. similar
to swimlanes the y-axis could reect the role associated to an activity.
comparable to a gantt chart, the x-axis could reect some temporal
aspect.
in section 4.6 we argued that process models often abstract from the things
that really matter. the above examples show that models can express im-
portant non-functional elements graphically. however, it is important to use
these conventions in a consistent manner across dierent maps.
note that in addition to showing important non-functional elements
graphically, the understandability of process models is an important issue
often limiting the use of complex process models. in [19,20] various patterns
are presented that can be used to reduce the complexity of process models
by modifying the abstract and concrete syntax of a process model.
5 breathing life into process models
in this paper, we posed the question \what makes a good process model?".
to address the question we did not propose a new notation or methodology.
instead we exposed problems related to the way process models are con-
structed and used. these problems were identied while conducting dozens
of process mining projects. process mining sheds a new light on the role of
models. the automatic generation of process models (play-in) shows that
one should notaim at the creation of a single model; instead one should
focus on the capability to generate appropriate models based on the ques-
tions at hand . the direct connection between event log and process model
(replay) can be exploited to show deviations and to enrich the models with
information that really matters (e.g., showing bottlenecks).
experiences with process mining suggest that process models should be
seen as the \maps" describing the operational processes of organizations.
the \map metaphor" was used to illustrate various problems. similarly,
information systems can be looked at as \navigation systems" guiding the
ow of work in organizations. based on maps of the organization and its
processes, the information systems should assist its users in reaching desired
\destinations".
unfortunately, many organizations fail in creating and maintaining ac-
curate process maps. often process models are outdated and have little
to do with reality. moreover, most information systems fail to provide the20 w.m.p. van der aalst
functionality oered by todays navigation systems. for instance, workers
are not guided by the information system and need to work behind the
system's back to get things done. in fact, useful information such as the
\estimated arrival time" of a running case is not provided. however, pro-
cess mining techniques providing operational support (e.g., predictions and
recommendations) [1,3] can be used to realize such functionality.
process mining can be used to breathe life into process models. see for
example figure 5(d) showing a map with real estate for sale and figure 5(e)
showing brisbane's trac jams. similarly, event data can be used to show
congestion in business processes.
by establishing a close connection between process maps and the actual
behavior recorded in event logs, it is possible to realize information system
with tomtom-like functionality [1]. analogous to tomtom's navigation de-
vices, process mining tools can help end users (a) by navigating through
processes (e.g., zoom in and zoom out), (b) by projecting dynamic infor-
mation on process maps (e.g., showing \trac jams" in business processes),
and (c) by providing predictions regarding running cases (e.g., estimating
the \arrival time" of a case that is delayed). we refer the reader to the
process mining tool prom that operationalizes these ideas [3].
