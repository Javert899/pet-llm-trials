abstract 
process mining provides new ways to utilize the abundance of data in enterprises. suddenly many organizations realize that 
survival is not possible without exploiting available data intelligently. a new profession is emerging: the data scientist.  ju st 
like computer science emerged as a new di scipline from mathematics when computers became abundantly available, we now 
see the birth of data science as a new discipline driven by the torrents of data available today. process mining will be an integral part of the data scientist's t oolbox. also enterprise  computing will need to focus on process innova tion through the 
intelligent use of event data.  
this keynote talk will focus on challenges related to "process mining in the large", i.e., dealing with many processes, many 
actors, many data sources, and huge amounts of data at the sa me time. by adequately addressing these challenges (e.g., using 
process cubes) we get a new kind of superglue that will impact the future of enterprise computing.
