abstract. process mining techniques can be used to extract non-trivial
process-related knowledge and thus generate interesting insights from
event logs. similarly, bioinformatics aims at increasing the understand-
ing of biological processes through the analysis of information associated
with biological molecules. techniques developed in both disciplines can
benet from one another, e.g., sequence analysis is a fundamental as-
pect in both process mining and bioinformatics. in this paper, we draw
a parallel between bioinformatics and process mining. in particular, we
present some initial success stories that demonstrate that the emerg-
ing process mining discipline can benet from techniques developed for
bioinformatics.

1 introduction
bioinformatics aims at increasing the understanding of biological processes and
entails the application of computational techniques to understand and organize
the information associated with biological macromolecules [1]. sequence analysis
or sequence informatics is a core aspect of bioinformatics that is concerned with
the analysis of dna/protein sequences1and has been an active area of research
for over four decades.
process mining is a relatively young research discipline aimed at discovering,
monitoring and improving real processes by extracting knowledge from event
logs readily available in today's information systems [2]. business processes leave
trails in a variety of data sources (e.g., audit trails, databases, and transaction
logs). hence, every process instance can be described by a trace, i.e., a sequence
of events. process mining techniques are able to extract knowledge from such
traces and provide a welcome extension to the repertoire of business process
1dna stores information in the form of the base nucleotide sequence, which is a string
of four letters (a, t, g and c) while protein sequences are sequences dened over
twenty amino acids and are the fundamental determinants of biological structure
and function.2 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst
analysis techniques. the topics in process mining can be broadly classied into
three categories (i) discovery , (ii) conformance , and (iii) enhancement . process
discovery deals with the discovery of models from event logs. for example, there
are dozens of techniques that automatically construct process models (e.g., petri
nets or bpmn models) from event logs [2]. discovery is not restricted to control-
ow; one may also discover organizational models, etc. conformance deals with
comparing an apriori model with the observed behavior as recorded in the log
and aims at detecting inconsistencies/deviations between a process model and
its corresponding execution log. in other words, it checks for any violation be-
tween what was expected to happen and what actually happened . enhancement
deals with extending or improving an existing model based on information about
the process execution in an event log. for example, annotating a process model
with performance data to show bottlenecks, throughput times etc.
despite several success stories there are still signicant challenges that need
to be addressed in applying process mining techniques on real-life event logs.
some of these challenges include:
{dealing with less structured processes: most processes mined from real-life logs
tend to be less structured than what stakeholders expect. the discovered pro-
cess models are often spaghetti-like and are hard to comprehend. many factors
lead to such a behavior e.g., heterogeneity of cases, ne granular events, etc.
process models can be seen as \maps" describing the operational processes
of organizations. there is a need for techniques that enable the discovery of
navigable process maps with seamless zoom-in/zoom-out facility (hierarchical
process models with dierent perspectives).
{dealing with ne granular event logs: some event logs (especially those that
emanate from large scale processes, high-tech systems such as medical systems,
copiers and scanners, etc) contain events at a very low abstraction level. stake-
holders would like to view processes at a more coarse-grained level. there is
a need for (semi-)automated means of aggregating low-level events into high-
level events. voluminous data is a natural side eect of such ne granular event
logs. this imposes an additional requirement on the process mining techniques
to be scalable as well.
{provisions for process diagnostics: the lion's share of process mining research
has been devoted to control-ow discovery. process diagnostics, which encom-
passes process conformance checking, auditing, process performance analysis,
anomaly detection, diagnosis, inspection of interesting patterns and the like,
is gaining prominence in recent years [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. there is a need for tech-
niques that assist auditors and analysts in their diagnostic eorts [8].
{dealing with process changes: contemporary process mining techniques assume
the processes to be in steady state. however, in reality, processes may change
to adapt to changing circumstances, e.g., new legislation, extreme variationswhen process mining meets bioinformatics 3
in supply and demand, seasonal eects, etc. concept drift refers to the situ-
ation in which the process is changing while being analyzed [9]. there is a
need for techniques that deal with such \second order dynamics". analyzing
such changes is of utmost importance to get an accurate insight on process
executions at any instant of time.
it is important to note that, to a large extent, sequence analysis is a fundamen-
tal aspect in almost all facets of process mining and bioinformatics. in spite of
all the peculiarities specic to business processes and process mining, the rel-
atively young eld of process mining should, in our view, take account of the
conceptual foundations, practical experiences, and analysis tools developed by
sequence informatics researchers over the last couple of decades. in this paper,
we describe some of the analogies between the problems studied in both disci-
plines. we present some initial successes which demonstrate that process mining
techniques can benet from such a cross-fertilization.
the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. section 2 introduces some of
the basic process mining concepts and illustrates some of the challenges already
mentioned. the subsequent sections relate ideas and techniques from bioinfor-
matics to process mining. section 3 points out similarities in the structuring
mechanisms used in both domains, e.g., the hierarchy of protein structures is
compared to the hierarchical structuring of events in processes. section 4 dis-
cusses commonalities between alignments in biology and traces in event logs.
section 5 relates phylogeny (the creation of tree structures showing inferred
evolutionary relationships among various biological species) to process congu-
ration. section 6 concludes the paper.
2 preliminaries: process mining
the goal of this paper is to show that process mining can benet from ideas and
techniques originating from bioinformatics. however, before doing so, we rst
introduce some of the basic process mining concepts and illustrate that there
are indeed several problems to be tackled.
process mining serves a bridge between data mining and business process mod-
eling. the goal is to extract process-related knowledge from event data recorded
by a variety of systems (ranging from sensor networks to enterprise information
systems). starting point for process mining is an event log. we assume that
events can be related to process instances (often called cases) and are described
by some activity name. the events within a process instance are ordered. there-
fore, a process instance is often represented as a trace over a set of activities.
in real-life event logs, events have timestamps, associated resources (e.g. the
person executing the activity), transactional information (e.g., start, complete,
or suspend), data attributes (e.g., amount or type of customer). however, for
clarity, we abstract from such additional information. therefore, we can use the
following basic notations:4 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst
{denotes the set of activities .+is the set of all non-empty nite sequences
of activities from .
{ a process instance (i.e. case) is described as a trace over, i.e., a nite
sequence of activities. examples of traces are abcd andabbbad .
{ lett=t(1)t(2)t(3):::t(n)2+be a trace over .t(k) represents the
kthactivity in the trace. jtj=ndenotes the length of the trace t.
{ an event log ,l, corresponds to a multi-set (or bag) of traces from +. for
example,l= [abcd;abcd;abbbad ] is a log consisting of three cases. two cases
follow trace abcd and one case follows trace abbbad .

fig. 1. process discovery aims to learn a process model (in this case a petri net) from
traces of activities.
as mentioned in section 1, event logs can be used to conduct three types of
process mining: (i) discovery, (ii) conformance, and (iii) enhancement [2]. pro-
cess discovery|discovering a process model from example behavior recordedwhen process mining meets bioinformatics 5
in an event log|is one of the most challenging tasks in process mining. to-
day there are dozens of process discovery techniques generating process mod-
els using dierent notations (petri nets, epcs, bpmn, heuristic nets, etc.).
fig. 1 illustrates the basic idea of process discovery. an event log contain-
ing detailed information about events is transformed into a multiset of traces
l= [abdeh;adceg;acdefbdeg;adbeh;acdefdcefcdeh ;acdeg;:::]. process dis-
covery techniques are able to discover process models such as the petri net shown
in fig. 1.
event logs may be incomplete and contain noise . noise refers to rare and in-
frequent behavior not representative for the typical behavior of the process. in-
completeness refers to the problem that one typically sees only a fraction of all
possible behaviors. traces that are not seen in the log are not necessarily impos-
sible; we only see positive examples and no negative examples. process mining
algorithms need to be able to deal with noise and incompleteness. generally, we
use four main quality dimensions for judging the quality of the discovered process
model: tness ,simplicity ,precision , and generalization [2]. a model with good
tness allows for the behavior seen in the event log. the simplest model that
can explain the behavior seen in the log, is the best model (occam's razor). a
model that is not precise is \undertting". undertting is the problem that the
model over-generalizes the example behavior in the log, i.e., the model allows for
behaviors very dierent from what was seen in the log. a model that does not
generalize is \overtting". overtting is the problem that a very specic model
is generated whereas it is obvious that the log only holds example behavior, i.e.,
the model explains the particular sample log, but a next sample log of the same
process may produce a completely dierent process model.

fig. 2. spaghetti process describing the diagnosis and treatment of 2765 patients in a
dutch hospital. the process model was constructed based on an event log containing
114,592 events. there are 619 dierent activities (taking event types into account)
executed by 266 dierent individuals (doctors, nurses, etc.)6 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst
the challenges related to process mining are best explained using an example.
fig. 2 shows an example of a typical spaghetti process discovered using conven-
tional process mining techniques [2]. the complexity of the diagram illustrates
the problems and challenges mentioned in section 1. in the remainder of the
paper, we show how ideas and techniques originating from bioinformatics can
help to address these.
3 from sequence to structure
a dna sequence motif is dened as a nucleic acid sequence pattern that has
some biological signicance (both structural and functional) [10]. these motifs
are usually found to recur in dierent genes or within a single gene. for ex-
ample, tandem repeats (tandemly repeating dna) are associated with various
regulatory mechanisms such as protein binding [11]. more often than not, se-
quence motifs are also associated with structural motifs found in proteins thus
establishing a strong correspondence between sequence and structure. protein
structures manifest as a hierarchy of four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and
quaternary. primary structure is the basic level and corresponds to the linear
sequence of amino acids. secondary structures result from the regular folding of
regions within the amino acid sequence into particular structural patterns e.g.,
-helix,-sheets,-turns, loops, etc. tertiary and quaternary structures result
from the folding of primary structure and secondary structural elements in 3
dimensions. fig. 3 depicts the hierarchy of protein structures.

likewise, common subsequences of activities in an event log that are found to
recur within a process instance or across process instances have some domainwhen process mining meets bioinformatics 7
(functional) signicance. in [12], we adopted the sequence patterns (e.g., tan-
dem repeats, maximal repeats etc.) proposed in the bioinformatics literature,
correlated them to commonly used process model constructs (e.g., tandem re-
peats and tandem arrays correspond to simple loop constructs), and proposed a
means to form abstractions over these patterns. the abstractions thus uncovered
have a strong domain signicance from a functionality point of view. using these
abstractions as a basis, we proposed a two-phase approach to process discovery
[13]. the rst phase comprises of pre-processing the event log with abstractions
at a desired level of granularity and the second phase deals with discovering the
process maps with seamless zoom-in/out facility. fig. 4 summarizes the overall
approach. note the similarity with fig. 3.

taining to these patterns dene abstractions that correspond to micro-structures (or
sub-processes). the top-level process model can be viewed as a macro-structure that
subsumes the micro-structures.
fig. 5 highlights the dierence between the traditional approach to process dis-
covery and the two-phase approach. note that the process model (map) discov-
ered using the two-phase approach is simpler. our approach supports the ab-
straction of activities based on their context and type, and provides a seamless
zoom-in and zoom-out functionality. fig. 5 illustrates that a cross-fertilization
between bioinformatics and process mining enables the discovery of hierarchical
process models. this provides a new perspective when dealing with ne granular
event logs and less structured processes.8 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst

4 sequence alignment and process diagnostics
multiple sequence alignment has been a subject of extensive research in compu-
tational biology for over three decades. sequence alignment is an essential tool in
bioinformatics that assists in unraveling the secondary and tertiary structures
of proteins and molecules, their evolution and functions, and in inferring the
taxonomic, phylogenetic or cladistic relationships between organisms, diagnoses
of genetic diseases, etc. [14, 15].
in [16], we have adapted sequence alignment to traces in an event log and showed
that it carries signicant promise in process diagnostics. the goal of trace align-
ment is to align traces in such a way that event logs can be easily explored.
given a multi-set of traces t= [t1;t2;:::;t n], trace alignment can be dened
as a mapping of tto another multi-set of traces t= [t1;t2;:::;tn] where
ti2([f g )+for 1in. in addition, the following three properties need
to be satised with respect to tandt:
{ each trace in tis of the same length i.e., there exists an m2nsuch that
jt1j=jt2j==jtnj=m
{tiis equal totiafter removing all gap symbols `  ' and
{ there is no k2f1;:::;mgsuch that81inti(k) = .
trace alignment can be used to explore the process in the early stages of anal-
ysis and to answer specic questions in later stages of analysis. fig. 6 depictswhen process mining meets bioinformatics 9
the results of trace alignment for a real-life log from a rental agency2. every
row corresponds to a process instance and time increases from left to right. the
horizontal position is based on logical time rather than real timestamps. if two
rows have the same activity name in the same column, then the corresponding
two events are very similar and are therefore aligned. note that the same activ-
ity can appear in multiple columns. by reading a row from left to right, we can
see the sequence of activities (i.e., the trace) that was executed for a process in-
stance. process instances having the same trace can be grouped into one row to
simplify the diagram. the challenge is to nd an alignment that is as simple and
informative as possible. for example, the number of columns and gaps should
be minimized while having as much consensus as possible per column.

fig. 6. an example of trace alignment for a real-life log from a rental agency. each
row refers to a process instance. columns describe positions in traces. consider now
the cell in row yand column x. if the cell contains an activity name a, then aoccurred
for case yat position x. if the cell contains no activity name (i.e., a gap \  "), then
nothing happened for yat position x.
trace alignment can assist in answering a variety of diagnostic questions. for
example, one can get answers to questions such as:
{what is the most common (likely) process behavior that is executed?
the consensus sequence of an alignment, which captures the major activity in
each column, represents the most common process behavior that is executed
2since the whole alignment is not legible, we highlight the interesting pat-
terns/activities at the top and the bottom of the gure.10 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst
and can be considered as the back-bone sequence for the process.
{are there any common patterns of execution in my traces?
common execution patterns are captured in the form of well conserved re-
gions (columns) in the alignment. for example, the activity sequence b0e0a5
(at columns 5 7) corresponding to the activities, planning of first insp-
ection ,preparation of lease termination form , and is first inspe-
ction performed? respectively, is common across all the traces.
{where do my process instances deviate and what do they have in common?
deviations, exceptional behavior and rare event executions are captured in
regions that are sparsely lled i.e., regions with lot of gap symbols (  ) or in
regions that are well conserved with a few rare gaps.
for example, it could be seen that only one of the traces (sixth trace in the
alignment) has the activity subsequence a9e9a5 in columns 8 10. activity
a5in column 7 corresponds to the check, is first inspection performed?
and the activity subsequence a9e9a5 corresponds to the scenario where the
result of the check was negative due to the fact that the tenant was not at
home. a9corresponds to the activity of sending a letter to the tenant and e9
corresponds to the activity of rescheduling the rst inspection.
{what are the contexts in which an activity or a set of activities is executed in
my event log?
trace alignment provides a complete perspective of activity executions in a
log including that of long range dependencies (any dependencies between ac-
tivities are reected as common execution patterns in the traces where they
manifest). furthermore, with rich interactive visualization (such as the options
of ltering columns containing an activity), trace alignment enables a exible
inspection of the log.
{what are the process instances that share/capture a desired behavior either
exactly or approximately?
one can formulate the desired behavior as an activity sequence and apply
trace alignment of this sequence with the traces in the log. traces/process
instances that share the desired behavior have a lot of their activities aligned
with that of the activities in the desired behavior sequence.
{are there particular patterns (e.g., milestones, concurrent activities etc.) in
my process?
concurrent activities manifest in mutually exclusive traces across dierent
columns in an alignment. for example, the activities h2b2 corresponding to
thedrafting of final note (h2) and archiving of lease termination
(b2) is concurrent in this process.
the application of sequence alignment in bioinformatics to process mining has
created an altogether new dimension to conformance checking; deviations andwhen process mining meets bioinformatics 11
violations are uncovered by analyzing just the raw event traces (thereby avoiding
the need for process models).
finding good quality alignments is notoriously complex. the initial results of
trace alignment are denitely encouraging. nonetheless, there are various new
challenges when adopting biological sequence alignment to trace alignment in
the context of business processes [17]. for example, biological sequences tend to
be homogenous whereas traces in semi-structured processes (e.g., care processes
in hospitals) tend to be heterogeneous. other dierences are the fact that traces
in an event log can be of very dierent lengths (e.g., due to loops) and may
be the result of concurrency. these characteristics provide new challenges for
sequence alignment.
5 phylogeny and process conguration
phylogenetics refers to the study of evolutionary relationships, and was one of
the rst applications in bioinformatics. a phylogeny is a tree representation of
the evolutionary history of a set (family) of organisms, gene/protein sequences
etc. the basic premise in phylogenetics is that genes have evolved by duplication
and divergence from common ancestors [18]. the genes can therefore exist in a
nested hierarchy of relatedness. fig. 7(a) depicts the phylogeny of some of the
species of hawaiian honeycreeper [19]. these variant species descended from a
single species over the last ten million years.

fig. 7. similarity between phylogeny and process conguration.12 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst
phylogeny is related to structuring variability within and between processes.
in the past couple of years, process conguration has gained prominence in the
bpm community [20]. process conguration is primarily concerned with manag-
ing families of business processes that are similar to one another in many ways
yet diering in some other ways. for example, processes within dierent mu-
nicipalities are very similar in many aspects and dier in some other aspects.
such discrepancies can arise due to characteristics peculiar to each municipal-
ity (e.g., dierences in size, demographics, problems, and policies) that need to
be maintained. furthermore, operational processes need to change to adapt to
changing circumstances, e.g., new legislation, extreme variations in supply and
demand, seasonal eects, etc. a congurable process model describes a family
of similar process models in a given domain [20], and can be thought of as the
genesis (root) of the family. all variants in the family can be derived from the
congurable model through a series of change patterns [21]. fig. 7(b) depicts
an example of a congurable model (parent) and two variants (children) derived
from it. one of the core research problems in process conguration is to auto-
matically derive congurable process models from specic models and event logs.
one can nd stark similarity between phylogenetics and process conguration .
techniques have been proposed in the bioinformatics literature to discover phy-
logenies both from (protein) structure as well as from sequences. this can be
compared to deriving congurable process models from specic models and from
event logs respectively. the adaptability of phylogeny construction techniques
to process conguration needs to be explored.
techniques from bioinformatics have also been adopted to trace clustering in
process mining [22, 23]. trace clustering was shown to be eective in dealing
with the heterogeneity in event logs [22, 23]. process mining results can be im-
proved by segregating heterogeneous cases into more homogenous clusters and
analyzing each cluster separately. sequence clustering techniques have been ap-
plied to deal with unlabeled event logs3in process mining [24]. experiences from
bioinformatics can also contribute to tooling and infrastructure eorts in pro-
cess mining. for example, visualization is one of the challenging problems in
process mining tooling4. a lot of current visualization means in process mining
become unmanageable when dealing with large event logs thereby compromising
the comprehensibility. process mining is typically an iterative activity driven by
questions from stakeholders and surprising analysis results. techniques for visu-
alization in process mining should focus on supporting the strong iterative and
interactive nature of event log analysis e.g., ranging from overview results to fo-

is used in many areas within bioinformatics (e.g., sequence matching, genome
browsing, multiple sequence alignment, etc.), with varying success, and good
tools already exist. there is signicant potential to learn from the success stories
that bioinformatics reveal, e.g., event logs refer to multi-sets of traces, which are
basically collections of sequences; sequence exploration and visualization tech-
niques in bioinformatics can be assessed for their adoption to event logs.
benchmarking and data repositories form another area where bioinformatics
has matured over the years. to cater to the rapidly increasing accumulation
of biological data, lots of eorts had been initiated in bioinformatics to create
advanced databases with analysis capabilities devoted to particular categories
e.g., genbank (cataloguing dna data), swiss-prot/trembl (repository of
protein sequences), etc. these repositories support features such as protein se-
quence/structural/functional comparison and classication benchmarks. process
mining being an emerging technology, such repositories and good benchmarks are
still missing. recently, several eorts had been initiated in the process modeling
and process mining community to create repositories with advanced support for
dealing with process model collections e.g., apromore [25], and repositories
of event logs [26]. process mining repositories and benchmarks should include:
{ event logs and process mining tasks e.g., control-ow discovery, organizational
model extraction, etc.
{ event logs, process models and associated tasks e.g., process conformance,
replay techniques, etc.
{ process models with associated characteristics e.g., functional (such as loan
application process), structural (such as the workow patterns present), be-
havioral, etc.
event log and process model comparison methods, search, and exploration are
some of the essential features that these repositories need to support. quality
metrics (e.g., tness, precision, generalization, computational complexity, etc.)
of state-of-the-art techniques also need to be captured in these repositories. this
enables the comparison of performance of a new algorithm/technique with con-
temporary methods. it is also desirable to elicit validation protocols to streamline
the ways in which such quality metrics are measured.
such an overlap between the goals combined with the promising initial results
calls for a more rigorous attempt at understanding and exploiting the synergy
between these two disciplines.
6 conclusions
bioinformatics and process mining share some common goals. in this paper, we
presented the commonalities between the problems and techniques studied in
bioinformatics and process mining. exploiting these commonalities, we demon-
strated that process mining can benet from the plethora of techniques developed14 r.p.j.c. bose and w.m.p. van der aalst
in bioinformatics. initial attempts at such a crossover have enabled the discovery
of hierarchical process models and helped extending the scope of conformance
checking to also cover the direct inspection of traces. although this is just a
rst step towards an interaction between the two disciplines, the results are very
promising and the relationship will be explored further in our future work.
