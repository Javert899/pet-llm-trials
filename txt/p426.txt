abstract
this demonstration paper describes version 4.1 of the promprocess mining tool. process mining tech-
niques attempt to extract non-trivial and useful process information from so-called “event logs”. prom
allowsforthediscoveryofdifferentprocessperspectives(e.g.,control-ﬂow,time,resources,anddata)and
supports related techniques such as control-ﬂow mining, performance analysis, resource analysis, confor-
mancechecking,veriﬁcation,etc. thismakespromapracticalandversatiletoolforprocessanalysisand
discovering.
within organizations there has been a shift from dataorientation to processorientation. by process we
mean the way an organization arranges there work and recourses, for instance the order in which tasks are
performedandwhichgroupofpeopleareallowedtoperformspeciﬁctasks. sometimes,organizationshave
very explicit process descriptions of the way the work is organized and this description is supported by a
process aware information system like, for instance, a workﬂow management system (wfm). but even if
there are explicit descriptions of the way the work should be done, the practical way of working can differ
considerablyfromtheprescribedwayofworking. othertimes,thereisno,oronlyaveryimmatureprocess
description available. however, in many situations it is possible to gather information about the processes
as they take place. for instance, in many hospitals, information about the different treatments of a patient
are registered (date, time, treatment, medical staff) for, reasons like ﬁnancial administration. this kind of
information in combination with appropriate mining techniques can also be used to get more insight in the
health care process. we use the term process mining for the method of distilling process knowledge from a
setof real executions.
figure 1 shows a fragment of the log in mxml format, the format used by prom. event logs are used
asthestartingpointformining. wedistinguishthreedifferentminingperspectives: (1)theprocessperspec-
tive, (2) the organizational perspective and (3) the case perspective. the process perspective focuses on the
control-ﬂow, i.e., the ordering of activities. the goal of mining this perspective is to ﬁnd a good character-
ization of all possible paths, expressed in terms of, for instance, a petri net. the organizational perspective
focuses on the originator ﬁeld, i.e., which performers are involved in performing the activities and how
they are related. the goal is to either structure the organization by classifying people in terms of roles and
organizational units or to show relations between individual performers. the case perspective focuses on
properties of cases. cases can be characterized by their path in the process or by the originators working
on a case. however, cases can also be characterized by the values of the corresponding data elements. for
example, in the phone repair log it may be interesting to know the differences in throughput times between
differenttelephone types.
to address the three perspectives and the logical and performance issues a set of plug-ins has been
developed for the prom framework [2]. prom is open source and uses a plug-able architecture, e.g., people
canadd newprocess mining techniques by adding plug-ins without spending anyefforts on the loading and
ﬁlteringofeventlogsandthevisualizationoftheresultingmodels. anexampleistheplug-inimplementing
the®-algorithm [1], i.e., a technique to automatically derive petri nets from event logs. prom version 4.1
provides six different types of plug-ins, in total 142 plug-ins are available. prom is open source and can be
downloadedfrom www.processmining.org . formoredetailsaboutthepromframework,itsplug-ins,
