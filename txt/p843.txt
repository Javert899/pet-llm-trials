abstract. massive open online courses (moocs) provide means to
oﬀer learning material in a highly scalable and ﬂexible manner. learning
analytics (la) tools can be used to understand a mooc’s eﬀectiveness
and suggest appropriate intervention measures. a key dimension of such
analysis is through proﬁling and understanding students’ learning behav-
ior. in this paper, we make use of process mining techniques in order to
trace and analyze students’ learning habits based on mooc data. the
objective of this endeavor is to provide insights regarding students and
their learning behavior as it relates to their performance. our analysis
shows that successful students always watch videos in the recommended
sequence and mostly watch in batch. the opposite is true for unsuc-
cessful students. moreover, we identiﬁed a positive correlation between
viewing behavior and ﬁnal grades supported by pearson’s, kendall’s and
spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients.

1 introduction
massive open online courses (moocs) provide free learning opportunities
to a wider online community. they are gaining considerable momentum and
attract interests from accross diﬀerent professions. this increasing interest in
moocs triggers the need for continuous evaluation of their eﬀectiveness, as
many consider this learning approach to be in its infancy [8]. learning analyt-
ics(la) [7,11], attempts to provide useful insights pertaining to educational
data [4].
current la literature indicates that the focus has been on classical data
mining techniques to predict students’ dropout risk and to estimate students
retention rate etc., almost entirely using attributes such as students’ age, pre-
vious grades, race, and academic qualiﬁcations etc. [4,5]. this paper aims to
analyze behavior. therefore, classical statistical and data mining techniques are
less appropriate. instead, we use process mining [1].this adds a new perspective
based on the actual behavior exhibited by students as they learn.
18process mining provides a set of algorithms, tools and techniques to analyze
event data [1]. three main perspectives oﬀered by process mining include dis-
covery, conformance checking and enhancement [1]. discovery techniques allow
the enactment of process models from log data. conformance checking attempts
to verify conformity to a predeﬁned model and identify deviations, if any, while
enhancement provides for models to be improved based on results of process
discovery and conformance checking [1].
given the online-based format and nature of moocs, it is possible to track
students’ activities following the individual clicks they make on the course web-
pages. the data generated this way can give us insights into how and when
students follow lectures, and how they prepare for exams. due to its popularity
and availability of data, we analyze a mooc hosted on the coursera platform.
coursera keeps track of all students and staﬀ activity details useful for our anal-
ysis. we extract and translate students’ behavioral data into a sequence of events
and analyze it in order to answer questions such as:
1. how do students watch lecture videos? what is the learning process?
2. what are the general viewing habits exhibited during this process?
3. what is the impact of such behavior/habits on the overall performance?
theremainderofthispaperisstructuredasfollows.weintroduceourcasestudy,
the dataset used for analysis followed by a succint description of how events
logs are derived from coursera’s data in section 2. in section 3, we describe
students’ learning behavior using process mining techniques: dotted chart and
process discovery. in section 4, we discuss learning behaviors following confor-
mance checking alignments. in section 5, we measure and discuss the correlation
between students’ learning behaviors and ﬁnal grades. section 6 concludes this
paper and discusses possible future directions.
2 mooc data: the coursera case
coursera subdivises raw data into three categories: general data, forums data
and personal identiﬁcation data. in total, the standard model comprises 59 ta-
bles storing information about users’ privileges, announcements regarding the
course, all forums details, assessements and evaluation data, course grades, sub-
missions details etc. for the purpose of this study, we consider data obtained
from coursera for the ﬁrst instance of the mooc “process mining: data science
in action” which ran from november 11, 2014 to january 8, 2015. the overall
statistics are detailed in table 1.
we have limited our analysis to data about direct student behavior. the
datasetsweanalyzearecenteredaroundthe students participatinginthemooc,
and the stream of click events they generated on the course webpages. a refer-
ence model for this selected part of the dataset can be found in [9].
clickstream as students click on videos, they leave a trail of click events ,
called a clickstream associated with a particular lecture, or a particular quiz sub-
mission. in addition to the pages visited by a student (recorded as a pageview ac-

student for each student, we know the exact time the student registered ,
and if they participated in the special (paid) signature track or not. we also
know if they get a fail,normalordistinction grade .
course structure lectures and quizzes are grouped into sections (weeks).
each section is visible to the students at a predetermined time (the open time ).
within a section, lectures and quizzes may have their own open time, to guide
students to follow a particular study rhythm. finally, quizzes can also have
deadlines (the close time ).
before we use process mining on this data for our analysis, we ﬁrst need to
build an event log. to do this, we need to decide which events are within scope
and how events are grouped into cases. as an example, consider the sample data
in table 2. the resulting event log is shown in table 3. each student in table 2
becomes one case in table 3. for each case, we store the data available about the
student, including their course grade data. for each clickstream event, we create
an event belonging to the corresponding case (based on the student userid). in
this example, we only consider lecture pageview actions. for each clickstream
event, we store the click event data, including the referenced lecture as event
name.
3 visualization of learning behavior
in this section we use the dotted chart and a process mining discovery algorithm
(fuzzy miner [1]) to visualize the event data and discover the actual learning
process. the aim is to visually provide insights on the overall mooc and proﬁle
students’ behavior throughout the duration of the mooc. we consider three
important dimensions in this analysis: the general lecture videos viewing habit,
the quiz submission behavior as well as a combination of both. these insights
can help to understand how students study and what impact such behaviors
have on their involvement in the mooc.

we subdivide students into separate groups based on the assumption that
similar group of students exhibit common behaviors. the ﬁrst criteria for group-
ing is the type of certiﬁcate students enroll for. in order to acquire a signature
track certiﬁcate, one is required to pay a fee and this motivation can trans-
late into the exhibited level of commitment to learning. the second criteria is
the achievement level or ﬁnal grade. by clustering students according to their
performance, we can highlight common characteristics and important inherent
patterns. a detailed analysis can be found in [9]. for illustrative purposes, we
only provide selective displays in this paper.
3.1 visualising viewing behavior
we make use of the dotted chart in order to visualize the path followed by
students while viewing videos. this provides a broad representation of students’
watching behavior throughout the course.
in figure 1, the dotted chart depicts the viewing behavior for all the students
having registered for the mooc focusing on when and how they watch videos.
thex-axis depicts the time expressed in weeks, while the y-axis represents stu-
dents. seven diﬀerent colors represent diﬀerent events at a given time as carried

by students. the white dots show the timing when students viewed miscella-
neous videos (two videos on course background and introduction to tools). all
videos for week 1 are depicted with the blue dots, green dots represent videos
for week 2, gray dots show the distribution for videos in week 3, all yellow dots
show lecture views for week 4, week 5 videos are seen in red while week 6
lecture videos are depicted by dark green dots.
looking at this visualisation, we can observe that:
–a signiﬁcant number of students drop out throughout the duration of the
course. this can trigger further investigations to identify the deriving cause,
i.e, follow-up emails, and take appropriate actions.
–many stop watching after the ﬁrst week but about 50% of students drop out
after the second week of the course. some actually even quit after watching
the introductory videos (a handful of them).
–not all students watch the videos in sequence. although all of them watch
week 1 before watching week 2, figure 1 also demonstrates that even to-
wards the end of the course, many still watch week 1 and go back and
forth. this also indicates that some videos are watched repeatedly and that
a number of students progressively join the course later than the starting
date.
in order to get detailed insights of this trend, we can also group the students
into subgroups based on their respective proﬁles. we make this classiﬁcation
based on their ﬁnal performance (distinction, normal and fail) and the type of
the certiﬁcate they sign up for (signature or non-signature track). a detailed
visualization for these respective groups can be found in [9]. we only consider
distinction students on signature track as an illustration in figure 2.
in figure 2, these students follow a sequential pattern as they watch the
videos. some join a little late at week 2 or week 3, but the general trend re-
22fig.1: dotted chart depicting a general viewing behavior throughout the dura-
tion of the mooc
mains that most of them watch videos sequentially as they are made available.
this can be seen by looking at the demarcation imposed by respective lecture
videos colors. this is also captured by the process models as depicted in fig-
ure 3. successful students follow videos sequentially with orderly loops while
unsuccessfull students appear to be volatile and unpredictable in their watching
pattern. in the next section, we look at the respective process models depicting
both successful and unsuccessful students’ learning paths.
3.2 process discovery
process discovery entails learning a process model from the event log. one can
make use of an event log as an input to a number of process mining algorithms in
order to visualize and enact the real behavior (sequential steps) of students. we
used the fuzzy miner to mine our dataset. rather than showing all the students’
process models, we consider for illustrative purposes 2 extremes: the distinction
students on signature track and failing students not on signature track. the
resulting models are displayed in figure 3.
the models in figure 3 indicate that distinction students tend to have a more
structured learning process, with a single path where possible loops are high-
lighted. on the contrary, the failing students follow a very unstructured learning
process that exempliﬁes the volatitlity and unpredictability of their learning
patterns. although the fuzzy miner only shows the most dominant behavior,
figure 3 still shows that there are many alternative paths.
23fig.2: dotted chart for distinction students on signature track.
4 conformance checking and learning behavior
conformance checking can be used to uncover and quantify behavioral diﬀer-
ences exhibited by diﬀerent groups of students. here, we use the alignment-based
conformance checking approach [2,3]. there are 2 critical aspects of students’
behavior that we observe from the results of the conformance checking: watch
statusandviewing habit. with watch status , we aim at determining the se-
quence according to which each video is played, while the viewing habit deﬁnes
the interval time between successive videos. these insights were obtained after
performing conformance checking [1,2].
making an assumption that all students follow the course in sequence, we
designed a model to represent this hypothesis. this idealised model, also called
normative model, is depicted in figure 4. it is an aggregated version of the real
business process modeling notation (bpmn) model that shows only succession
and ﬂow between videos from weeks 1 to 6. the main reason for not showng
all videos in a chain is the high number of videos in the mooc. with over
60 videos, the model would not be readable in this paper. instead, the model
used in the experiment speciﬁes the ﬁrst lecture in the series “lecture 1.1: data
science and big data (17 min.)” as the ﬁrst task and the last lecture “lecture
6.9: data science in action (9 min.)” as the last task in the model. we also note
the lectures we skipped due to space constraints (lecture 1.3 to lecture 3.8 and
lecture 4.2 to lecture 6.8).
following figure 4, we performed alignment-based conformance checking [2]
and a detailed description of this analysis is provided in [10]. by exploring the
alignment details, we can thus analyze students’ learning behaviors. speciﬁcally,
24fig.3: process models for signature track distinction students with possible
“loopbacks” vs. non-signature track fail students with “loopbacks and devia-
tions”
25we can visualize details about the overall watch status andviewing habits in
sections 4.1 and 4.2.
fig.4: bpmn model for sequential viewing of videos from lecture 1.1 in week
1 to lecture 6.9 in week 6
4.1 video watch status
in order to label a video status, we consider moves that are generated by con-
formance alignment as seen in figure 5. there are 3 types of moves that can
be generated as a result. a move on log occurs when the task is found in the
log only, a move on model occurs when it is only found in the model, and a
synchronous move occurs in both the log and model [2]. hence, looking at these
three moves, we deﬁne the watch status as follows:
fig.5: conformance alignment moves
set watch status =
case when move = ‘synchronous’ then ‘watchedregularly’
when move = ‘modelonly’ then ‘notwatched’
when move = ‘logonly’ then
case when ordering_num in model < ordering_num in log
then ‘watchedearly’
else ‘watchedlate’
end
26fig.6: description of videos watch status

we illustrate with a single possible run of log with 4 transitions (lectures):
lect1.1, lect1.2, lect1.3 and lect1.4. we also consider an event log with trace
lect1.3, lect1.2, lect1.1
. with conformance alignments, we can identify the
videos watch status as depicted in figure 6. the overall videos status for sig-
nature track students for the duration of the course is presented in figure 7.
detailed results for other subgroups of students can be found in [10].

figure 7 indicates that successful students are consistent with watching
videos in sequence. the graph points out that the watch status watchedreg-
ularlyis dominant for successful students while there is a slight progression for
notwatched. unsuccessful students in most parts progressively stop watching
videos from week 1 and the trend can be observed increasing until week 6.
274.2 viewing habit
theviewing habit describes the time commitment in the students’ learning be-
havior. it depends on the time at which two successive videos are opened. in
order to deﬁne these habits, we count the number of minutes between open
times for successive videos and specify the thresholds as follows:
set viewing habit =
case when interval 30 then ‘inbatch’
when interval 60 then ‘after30min’
when interval 120 then ‘hourly’
when interval 720 then ‘halfdaily’
when interval 1440 then ‘daily’
when interval 10080 then ‘weekly’
else ‘skipped’
end
figure 8 shows a representation of students’ habits over 6 weeks. there is
a clear indication of the impact of viewing habit on performance and students’
ﬁnal grades. the most committed students, who watch mostly in batch appear
to be more successful than the rest.
the opposite trend is observed with regards to unsuccessful students who
increasinglyskipvideos.asthemoocstarts,someofthesestudentsaredevoted
to watching but as time progresses, they stop watching certain videos and this
shows accross the board for all unsuccessful students. moreover, unsuccessful
students’ behavior pertaining to watching in batch progressively decreases as
the weeks go by. the more videos were watched in batch in week 1, the less
they are in week 6.

284.3 viewing habit vs. watch status
it is also interesting to visualize the correlation between viewing habit andwatch
status. some of the questions we might try to answer are: “are students who
watch videos in batch watching videos sequentially?”, “is there a link between
both watch status andviewing habit ?”. in figure 9, we observe that students
who study in batch, mostly watch videos regularly (in sequence) than those who
skip videos.

figure 9 shows a relationship between the way people watch videos and
the interval of time between successive videos. it indicates that when students
watch videos in batch, they are more likely to follow a proper sequential pattern
indicated by status watchedregularly.
5 measuring correlation between learning behavior and
performance
measuring the correlation between learning behavior and performance can help
to quantify the observations made in sections 3 and 4. we consider three dif-
ferent statistical measures of correlation in order to determine the level of the
relationship between how students watch lecture videos (behavior) and their per-
formance (ﬁnal grades). we calculate the pearson’s, kendall’s and spearman’s
correlation coeﬃcients [6].
the pearson’s coeﬃcient determines the degree of a relationship or a lin-
ear correlation between two attributes, i.e. students’ viewing behavior and ﬁnal
29grades [6] while the kendall’s and spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients determine
the degree of a relationship between two attributes based on ranked data [6].
these coeﬃcients are between -1 and +1 indicating the degree of the correla-
tion. the plus (+) and minus (-) signs also indicate whether it is a negative or
a positive correlation.
we express, for this analysis, the learning behavior by the trace ﬁtness value
and label it as viewtrend in figure 10. we then compute the correlation coef-
ﬁcients between viewtrend and students’ ﬁnal grades (normal and distinction
grades). the values of viewtrend are between 0 and 1 indicating the scale of
students’ learning behavior, while the ﬁnal grades span from 0 to 100. figure 10
shows two graph matrices for both signature and non-signature track students.
in each matrix, three graphs (2 histograms and 1 scatterplot) are produced. the
histogram at the intersection of the same attribute, i.e normalgrade x normal-
grade, captures that attribute’s distribution for the considered population, i.e
signature-track students, while the scatterplots at the intersection of diﬀerent
attributes show their correlation distribution. on each scatterplot, the corre-
lation coeﬃcients are given in red, i.e 0.39/0.26/0.37, representing respectively
the pearson’s, kendall’s and spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients. we observe a
moderate and positive correlation as indicated by the values of the coeﬃcients
in figure 10. particularly, we observe that the pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient
has the highest value for both signature and non-signature track students given
by values 0.39 in figure 10a and 0.55 10b.
these results are critical as they indicate the existence a positive relationship
between the way people watch videos and the outcome of their performance.
nevertheless, the values of the correlation coeﬃcients (between 0.26 and 0.60)
also indicate that additional factors such as students’ background, focus level,
previous content knowledge, iq level etc. can be contributing factors to the
overall performance.
6 conclusion
learning analytics (la) [5,7] promises to provide insights from educational
data. in addition to current la work based mostly on traditional data mining
techniques [5], this paper proposes to use process mining in order to provide
insightful analysis based on the actual behavior of students.
taking our coursera mooc as a case study, we show the added value of
process mining on mooc data. our results demonstrated that the way students
watch videos as well as the interval between successive watched videos have a
direct impact on their performance. results indicate that successful students
follow a sequentially-structured watching pattern while unsuccessful students
are unpredictable and watch videos in a less structured way.
moreover, students’ learning behavior can be described from two dimensions:
watch status andviewing habit asdescribedinsection4.theresultsindicatethat

fig.10:pearson’s/kendall’s/spearman’scorrelationcoeﬃcientsmatrixforstu-
dents’ viewtrend and final grades(normal and disinction)
31in general, students’ viewing habit s are determined by the time between succes-
sive videos while the watch status is determined by the conformance alignments.
our results identiﬁed that students who watch videos regularly and in batch are
more likely to perform better than those who skip videos or procrastinate in
watching videos.
finally, we calculated three statistical measures of correlation considering
the pearson’s, kendall’s and spearman’s correlation coeﬃcients. the calculated
coeﬃcients ranged between 0.26 and 0.60 conﬁrming the existence of a positive
correlation between learning behavior and performance in a mooc as seen in
figure 10.
in the future, we aim at conducting additional experiments using other pro-
cess mining techniques described in [1] and analyze other paradigms of la on
moocs.
