abstract. in the area of industrial process mining, privacy-preserving
event data publication is becoming increasingly relevant. consequently,
the trade-o between high data utility and quantiable privacy poses
new challenges. state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on dierentially
private trace variant construction based on prex expansion methods.
however, these algorithms face several practical limitations such as high
computational complexity, introducing fake variants, removing frequent
variants, and a bounded variant length. in this paper, we introduce a
new approach for direct dierentially private trace variant release which
uses anonymized partition selection strategies to overcome the afore-
mentioned restraints. experimental results on real-life event data show
that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
plain data utility and result utility preservation.

1 introduction
in recent years, process mining and event data analysis have been successfully
deployed in many industries. the main objectives are to learn process models
from event logs for further behavioral inference (so-called process discovery ), to
extend existing models using event logs (so-called model enhancement ), or to
assess the alignment between a process model and an event log (so-called con-
formance checking ) [2]. however, often the underlying event data are bound to
personal identiers or other private information. a prominent example is the pro-
cess management of hospitals where the cases are patients being treated by sta.
without means of privacy protection, any adversary is able to extract sensitive
information about individuals and their properties. thus, privacy regulations,
such as gdpr [1], typically restrict data storage and access which motivates the
development of privacy preservation techniques.
the majority of state-of-the-art privacy preservation techniques are built on
dierential privacy (dp), which oers a noise-based privacy denition. this is
due to its important features, such as providing mathematical privacy guaran-
tees and security against predicate-singling-out attacks [3]. the goal of techniques
based on dp is to hide the participation of an individual in the released output
?funded under the excellence strategy of the federal government and the l ander. we also thank

by injecting noise. the amount of noise is mainly determined by the privacy
parameters, and, and the sensitivity of the underlying data. state-of-the-art
research targeting ( ;)-dp methods in process mining focuses on releasing raw
privatized activity sequences performed for cases, i.e., trace variants . table 1
shows a sample of such event data in the healthcare context, where each trace
variant belongs to a case, i.e., a patient, and one case cannot have more than one
trace variant. this format describes the control-ow of event logs that is basis
for the main process mining activities. the trace variant of a case is considered
sensitive information because it contains the complete sequence of activities per-
formed for the case that can be exploited to conclude private information, e.g.,
patient diseases in the healthcare context.
to achieve dierential privacy for trace variants, the state-of-the-art ap-
proach [12] inserts noise drawn from a laplacian distribution into the variant
distribution obtained from an event log. this approach has several drawbacks
including: (1) introducing fake variants , (2) removing frequent true variants , and
(3)limited length for generated trace variants . a recent work called sacofa [9],
attempts to mitigate drawbacks (1) and (2) by gaining knowledge regarding
the underlying process semantics from original event data. however, the privacy
quantication of all extra queries to gain knowledge regarding the underlying
semantics is not discussed. moreover, the third drawback still remains since
this work, similar to [12], employs a prex-based approach. the prex-based ap-
proaches need to generate all possible unique variants based on a set of activities
to provide dierential privacy for the original distribution of variants. since the
set of possible trace variants that can be generated given a unique set of activi-
ties is innite, the prex-based techniques need to bound the length of generated
sequences. also, to limit the search space these approaches typically include a
pruning parameter to exclude less frequent prexes.
we introduce an ( ;)-dp approach for releasing the distribution of trace
variants that focuses on the aforementioned drawbacks. in contrast to the prex-
based approaches, the underlying algorithm is based on ( ;)-dp for partition
selection that allows for a direct publication of arbitrarily long sequences [4]. em-
ploying dierentially private partition selection techniques, the actual frequencies
of all trace variants can directly be queried without guessing (generating) trace
variants. internally, random noise drawn from a specic geometric distribution
is injected into the corresponding frequencies, and all variants whose privatized
frequencies fall beyond a threshold are removed. hence, no fake trace variants are
introduced, and only some infrequent variants may disappear from the output.
moreover, no tedious ne-tuning has to be conducted and no computationally
expensive search needs to be included. in section 5, we introduce dierent met-
rics to evaluate the data and result utility preservation of our approach. wetravas: dierentially private trace variant selection for process mining 3
also run our experiments for the state-of-the-art prex-based methods and show
superior data and result utilities compared to these methods.
the remainder of this paper is structured as follows. in section 2, we provide a
summary of related work. preliminaries and notations are provided in section 3.
section 4 introduces the theoretical background of dierentially private partition
selection , and describes our travas algorithm. in section 5, the experimental
results based on real-life event logs are shown. section 6 concludes the paper.
2 related work
the research area of privacy and condentiality in process mining is recently
growing in importance. several techniques have been proposed to address the pri-
vacy and condentiality issues. in this paper, our focus is on the so-called noise-
based techniques that are based on the notion of dierential privacy . in [12],
the authors apply an ( ;)-dp mechanism to event logs to privatize directly-
follows relations and trace variants. the underlying principle uses a combina-
tion of an (;)-dp noise generator and an iterative query engine that allows an
anonymized publication of trace variants with an upper bound for their length.
sacofa [9] is the most recent extension of the aforementioned ( ;)-dp mecha-
nism that attempts to optimize the query structures with the help of underlying
semantics. another extension of [12] is the pripel approach, where more event
attributes can be secured using the so-called sequence enrichment [8].
whereas most of the aforementioned ideas target raw event logs, in [7], the
focus is on directly-follows graphs . during the edge generation, connections are
randomized using ( ;)-dp mechanisms to balance utility preservation and pri-
vacy risks. as the main benchmark model for our work, we choose the technique
by mannhardt et al. [12] since it focuses on trace variants and is the basis of most
of the other techniques. moreover, its privacy guarantees are directly proven by
(;)-dp mechanisms, i.e., no extra privacy analysis is required. nevertheless,
we also compare our results with sacofa as the most recent extension of the
benchmark to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.
3 preliminaries
in this section, we introduce the necessary mathematical concepts and denitions
utilized throughout the remainder of the paper. let abe a set.b(a) is the
set of all multisets over a. a multiset acan be represented as a set of tuples
f(a;a(a))ja2agwherea(a) is the frequency of a2a. givenaandbas two

3.1 event data
the data used by process mining techniques are typically collections of unique
events that are recorded per activity execution and characterized by their at-4 majid raei et al.
tributes. we denote eas the universe of events. then, a trace, which is a single
process execution, is represented as a sequence of events =he1;e2;:::;eni2e
belonging to the same case and having a xed ordering based on timestamps.
note that events are unique and cannot appear in more than one trace. more-
over, each case (individual) contributes to only one trace. an event log lcan be
represented as a set of traces le. our work focuses on the control-ow aspect
of an event log that only considers the activity attribute of events in traces. we
dene a simple event log based on activity sequences, so-called trace variants .

tiset of trace variants l2b(a).ldenotes the universe of simple event logs.
3.2 dierential privacy
in the following, we introduce the necessary concepts of ( ;)-dp for our re-
search. the main idea of dp is to inject noise into the original data in such a
way that an observer who sees the randomized output cannot tell if the infor-
mation of a specic individual is included in the data [6]. considering simple
event logs, i.e., the distribution of trace variants, as our sensitive event data,
dierential privacy can formally be dened as denition 3.
denition 3 (( ,)-dp for event logs). letl1andl2be two neighbour-
ing event logs that dier only in a single entry, e.g., l2=l1][]for any2a.
also, let2r>0and2r>0be two privacy parameters. a randomized mecha-
nismm;:l!l provides (;)-dp if for all san:pr[m;(l1)2s]

l0() =l() +xg, withxbeing realizations of i.i.d. random variables drawn
from a probability distribution.
in denition 3, as the rst privacy parameter species the probability ra-
tio, andas the second privacy parameter allows for a linear violation. in the
strict case of = 0,moers-dp. the randomness of respective mechanisms
is typically ensured by the noise drawn from a probability distribution that per-
turbs original variant-frequency tuples and results in non-deterministic outputs.
the smaller the privacy parameters are set, the more noise is injected into the
mechanism outputs, entailing a decreasing likelihood of tracing back the instance
existence based on outputs.
a commonly used ( ;0)-dp mechanism for real-valued statistical queries is
thelaplace mechanism. this mechanism injects noise based on a laplacian dis-
tribution with scale f=.fis called the sensitivity of a statistical query f.
intuitively, findicates the amount of uncertainty we must introduce into the
output in order to hide the contribution of single instances at ( ;0)-level. in our
context,fis the frequency of a trace variant. since one individual, i.e., a case,
contributes to only one trace, f=1. in case an individual can appear in moretravas: dierentially private trace variant selection for process mining 5
than one trace, the sensitivity needs to be accordingly increased assuming the
same value for the privacy parameter . state-of-the-art event data anonymiza-
tion frameworks such as our benchmark often use the laplace mechanism .
4 partition selection algorithm
we rst highlight the problem of partition selection and link it to event data
release. then, the algorithmic details are presented with a brief analysis.
4.1 partition selection
many data analysis tasks can be expressed as per-partition aggregation opera-
tions after grouping the data into an unbounded set of partitions. when iden-
tifying the variants of a simple log las categories, the transformation from l
to pairs (;l()) becomes a specic instance of these aggregation tasks. to ren-
der such queries dierentially private, two distinct steps need to be executed.
first, all aggregation results are perturbed by noise addition of suitable mech-
anisms. next, the set of unique partitions must be modied to prevent leakage
of information on the true data categories ( dierentially private partition selec-
tion) [4, 6]. in case of publicly known partitions or bounded partitions from a
familiar nite domain, the second step can be reduced to a direct unchanged re-
lease or a simple guessing-task, respectively. however, for the most general form
of unknown and innite category domains, guessing is not ecient anymore and
an (;)-dp partition selection strategy can be used instead.
recently, in [4], the authors proposed an ( ;)-dp partition selection ap-
proach, where they provided a proof of an optimal partition selection rule which
maximizes the number of released category-aggregation pairs while preserving
(;)-dp. in particular, the authors showed how the aforementioned anonymiza-
tion steps can be combined into an explicit ( ;)-dp mechanism based on a
k-truncated symmetric geometric distribution (k-tsgd), see denition 4. we
exploit the analogy between partition selection and simple event log publication
and transfer this mechanism to the event data context. denition 5 shows the
respective denition based on a k-tsgd.1
denition 4 (k-tsgd). given probability p2(0;1),m=p=(1+(1 p) 2(1 p)k+1),
andk1, the k-tsgd of (p;k)overzformally reads as:
k-tsgd [x=xjp; k] =(
m(1 p)jxjifx2[ k; k]
0 otherwise(1)
denition 5 (( ,)-dp for event logs based on k-tsgd). let2r>0
and2r>0be the privacy parameters, and mk tsgd
;:l!l be a randomized
mechanism based on a k-tsgd. given l2l as an input of the randomized
mechanism, an event log l0=f(;l0())j2l^l0()>kg2rng(mk tsgd

1a respective proof can be found in sec. 3 of [4].6 majid raei et al.

withxbeing realization of i.i.d random variables drawn from a k-tsgd with
parameters (p;k), wherep= 1 e andk=d1=ln((e+2 1)=(e+1))e.
denition 5 shows the direct ( ;)-dp release of trace variants by rst per-
turbing all variant frequencies and then truncating infrequent behavior. addi-
tionally, optimality is guaranteed w.r.t. the number of variants being published
due to the k-tsgd structure [4]. note that the underlying k-tsgd mechanism
assumes each case only contributes to one variant. in case this requirement needs
to be violated, sensitivity considerations force a decrease in ( ;).
the development of dierentially private partition selection enables signi-
cant performance improvements for private trace variant releases. as there are
innite activity sequences dening a variant, former approaches had to either
guess or query all of these potentially non-existing sequences in a cumbersome
fashion due to the ex-ante category anonymity in ( ;)-dp. on the contrary,
partition selection only needs one noisied aggregation operation followed by a
specic truncation. hence, the output contains only existing variants that are
independent of external parameters or query patterns.
4.2 algorithm design
algorithm 1 presents the core idea of travas which is based on denition 5. we
also propose a utility-aware extension of travas , so-called utravas , that utilizes
the privacy budgets, i.e., and, by several queries w.r.t. data utility. in this
paper, we focus on travas , the details of utravas are provided on github.2
algorithm 1 (travas) allows to anonymize variant-frequency pairs by inject-
ingk-tsgd noise within one run over the according simple log. after a simple
logland privacy parameters ( >0;> 0) are provided, the travas function rst
transforms ( ;) into k-tsgd parameters ( p;k). then, each variant frequency
l() becomes noisied using i.i.d k-tsgd noisex(see denition 5). eventu-
ally, the function removes all modied infrequent variants where the perturbed
frequencies yield numbers below or equal to k. due to the partition selection
mechanism, the actual frequencies of all trace variants can directly be queried

without guessing trace variants. thus, travas is considerably more ecient and
easier to implement than current state-of-the-art prex-based methods.
5 experiments
we compare the performance of travas against the state-of-the-art bench-
mark [12] and its extension ( sacofa [9]) on real-life event logs. due to algo-
rithmic dierences between our approach and the prex-based approaches, it
is particularly important to ensure a fair comparison. hence, we employ diver-
gently structured event logs and study a broad spectrum of privacy budgets
(;). moreover, the sequence cuto for the benchmark and sacofa is set to
the length that covers 80% of variants in each log, and the remaining pruning
parameter is adjusted such that on average anonymized logs contain a compara-
ble number of variants with the original log. note that travas guarantees the
optimal number of output variants due to its underlying dierentially private
partition selection mechanism [4], and it does not need to limit the length of the
released variants. thus, the aforementioned settings consider the limitations of
the prex-based approaches to have a fair comparison.
we select two event logs of varying size and trace uniqueness. as we discussed
in section 4, and it is considered in other research such as [12], [9], and [14],
infrequent variants are challenging to privatize. thus, trace uniqueness is an im-
portant analysis criterion. the sepsis log describes hospital processes for sepsis
patients and contains many rare traces [11]. in contrast, bpic13 has signicantly
more cases at a four times smaller trace uniqueness [5]. the events in bpic13
belong to an incident and problem management system called vinst. both logs
are realistic examples of condential human-centered information where the case
identiers refer to individuals. detailed log statistics are shown in table 2.
5.1 evaluation metrics
to assess the performance of an ( ;)-dp mechanism, suitable evaluation metrics
are needed to determine how valuable the anonymized outputs are w.r.t. the
original data. in this respect, we rst consider a data utility perspective where
the similarity between two logs is measured independent of future applications.
for our experiments, two respective metrics are considered. from [13], we adopt
relative log similarity that is based on the earth mover's distance between two
trace variant distributions, where the normalized levenshtein string edit distance
is used as a similarity function between trace variants. the relative log similarity
metric quanties the degree to which the variant distribution of an anonymized
log matches the original variant distribution on a scale from 0 to 1.
in addition, we introduce an absolute log dierence metric to account for sit-
uations where distribution-based metrics provide only dierent expressiveness.

fig. 1: the relative log similarity andabsolute log dierence results of anonymized bpic13 logs
generated by travas , the benchmark, and sacofa . each value represents the mean of 10 runs.
exemplary cases are event logs possessing similar variant distributions, but sig-
nicantly dierent sizes. for such scenarios, the relative log similarity yields high
similarity scores, whereas absolute log dierence can detect these size dispari-
ties. to derive an absolute log dierence value, we rst transform both input logs
into a bipartite graph of variant vertices. then a cost network ow problem [15]
is solved by setting demands and supplies to the absolute variant frequencies
and utilizing a levenshtein distance between variants as an edge cost. hence,
the resulting optimization value of an ( ;)-dp log resembles the number of
levenshtein operations to transform all respective variants into variants of the
original log. in contrast to our relative log similarity metric, this approach can
also penalize a potential matching impossibility. more information on the exact
algorithms is provided on github.3
besides comparing event logs based on data utility measures, we addition-
ally quantify the algorithm performance with process discovery oriented result
utilities . we use the inductive miner infrequent [10] with default noise threshold
of 20% to discover process models from the privatized event logs for all ( ;)
settings under investigation. then, we compare the models with the original
event log to obtain token-based replay tness and precision scores [2]. due to
the probabilistic nature of ( ;)-dp, we average all metrics over 10 anonymized
logs for each setting, i.e., 10 separate algorithm runs per setting.
5.2 data utility analysis
in this subsection, the results of the two aforementioned data utility metrics are
presented for both real-life event logs. we compare the performance of travas

values:2f2;1;0:1;0:01;0:001gand2f0:5;0:1;0:05;0:01;0:001g.
figure 1 shows the average results on bpic13 in a four-fold heatmap. the
grey elds represent a general unfeasibility of the strong privacy setting =0:001
for our benchmark method. due to the intense noise perturbation, the corre-
sponding variant generation process increased the number of articial variant
uctuations to an extent that could not be averaged in a reasonable time. apart
from this artifact, both relative log similarity and absolute log dierence show
superior performance of travas for most investigated ( ;) combinations. in
particular, for stronger privacy settings, travas provides a signicant advan-
tage over sacofa and benchmark. whereas more noise, i.e., lower ( ;) values,
generally decreases the output similarity to the original data, travas results
seem to particularly depend on . according to denition 5, this observation
can be explained by the stronger relation between kandcompared to kand.
the evaluation of the sepsis log is presented in fig. 2. in contrast to bpic13,
sepsis contains many variants occurring only once or twice. while our absolute
log dierence shows a similar expected trend with ( ;) as fig. 1, the relative log
similarity metric indicates almost constant values for the prex-based techniques
and a considerable -dependency for travas . we explain the resulting patterns
by examining the underlying data structure in more detail. as mentioned, the
frequency threshold koftravas strongly correlates with . hence, event logs
with prominent infrequent traces, e.g., sepsis, are signicantly truncated for
strong (;)-dp. since this variant removal leads to a distribution mismatch
when being compared to the original log, the relative log similarity forms a step-
wise pattern as in fig. 2. in contrast, the prex-based techniques iteratively
generate variants that may or may not exist in the original log. in logs with high10 majid raei et al.

trace uniqueness, there exist many unique variants that are treated similarly to
non-existing variants due to close frequency values, i.e., 0 and 1. thus, in the
anonymized logs, unique variants either appear with larger noisied frequencies
or are replaced with fake variants having larger noisied frequencies. this process
remains the same for dierent privacy settings but with larger frequencies for
stronger privacy guarantees. hence, the relative log similarity metric stays almost
constant although the noise increases with stronger privacy settings. however,
theabsolute log dierence metric can show dierences. utravas shows even
better performance w.r.t. the data utility metrics.4
5.3 process discovery analysis
we conduct a process discovery investigation based on tness and precision
scores. for the sake of comparability, the experimental setup remains unchanged.
figure 3 shows the results for bpic13, where the original tness and precision
values are 0.995 and 0.877, respectively. travas provides almost perfect replay
behavior w.r.t. tness while the prex-based alternatives show lower values. this
observation can be explained by the dierent algorithmic approach of travas
and some characteristics of bpic13. travas only adopts true behavior that
results in a simplied representation of the original process model. due to the
rather low trace uniqueness and comparably large log-size of bpic13, this sim-
plication is minor enough to allow an almost perfect tness. in contrast, the
fake variants generated by prex-based approaches negatively aect their tness
scores. the precision metric evaluates the fraction of behavior in a model dis-
covered from an anonymized log that is not included in the original log. due to

fig. 4: the tness andprecision results of anonymized sepsis event logs generated by travas , the
benchmark, and sacofa . each value represents the mean of 10 algorithm runs.
the direct release mechanism of travas that only removes infrequent variants,
we achieve more precise process models than the alternatives. furthermore, the
correlation between threshold kand noise intensity enables travas to even rise
precision for stronger privacy guarantees. conversely, the fake variants generated
by prex-based approaches can lead to inverse behavior.
figure 4 shows the tness andprecision results for sepsis, where the original
tness and precision values are 0.952 and 0.489, respectively. whereas travas
dominates the prex-based approaches w.r.t. precision as in fig. 3, our tness
score shows a slight under-performance. unlike bpic13, the high trace unique-
ness and smaller log-size prohibit the underlying partition selection mechanism
to achieve negligible threshold for infrequent variant removal. thus, the discov-
ered process models from anonymized logs miss parts of the original behavior.
this shows that carefully tuned prex-based mechanisms might have an advan-
tage in terms of tness for small logs with many unique traces. we particularly
note that this limitation of travas vanishes as soon as the overall log-size grows.
the reason lies in the size-independent threshold kwhile the pruning parameter
of prex-based approaches intensies with the data size. the process discovery
analyses for utravas , available on github, show even better performance.
6 discussion and conclusion
in this paper, we demonstrated a novel approach to release anonymized dis-
tributions of trace variants based on ( ;)-dp mechanisms. the corresponding
algorithm ( travas ) overcomes the variant generation problems of prex-based
mechanisms (see section 1) and directly queries all true variants. our exper-12 majid raei et al.
iments with two dierently structured event logs showed that travas outper-
forms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of data utility metrics and process-
discovery-based result utility for most of the privacy settings. in particular, for
large event logs containing many long trace variants, our implementation has no
ecient alternative. regarding limitations and future improvements, we gener-
ally note that the dierentially private partition selection mechanism only works
for>0, whereby limits of small values can be problematic on large collections
of infrequent variants. thus, all use cases that require strict -dp still need to
apply prex-based mechanisms. finding a more ecient solution for =0 seems
to be a valuable and interesting future research topic.
