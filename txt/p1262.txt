process mining emerged as a new discipline around the turn of the century. the combi-
nation of event data and process models poses interesting scientiﬁc problems. initially,
the focus was on the discovery of process models (e.g., petri nets) from example traces.however, over time the scope of process mining broadened in several directions. next to
process discovery, topics such as conformance checking and performance analysis were
added. different perspectives were added (e.g., time, resources, roles, costs, and casetypes) to move beyond control-ﬂow models. along with directly-follows graph (dfgs)
and petri nets, a wide range of process model notations has been explored in the context of
event data. examples include declarative process models, process trees, artifact-centric
and object-centric process models, uml activity models, and bpmn models. in recent
years, the focus also shifted from backward-looking to forward-looking, connectingprocess mining to neighboring disciplines such as simulation, machine learning, and
automation.
over the past two decades, the discipline did not only expand in terms of scope but
also in terms of adoption and tool support. the ﬁrst commercial process mining tools
emerged 15 years ago (futura process intelligence, disco, etc.). now there are over 40
commercial products next to open-source process mining tools such as prom, pm4py,and bupar. the adoption in industry has accelerated in the last ﬁve years. in several
regions of the world, most of the larger companies are already using process mining,
and the process mining market is expected to double every 18 months in the comingyears.
given the amazing developments in the last two decades, a comprehensive process
mining summer school is long overdue. this book contains the core material of the ﬁrstsummer school on process mining organized by the ieee task force on process mining.
the task force on process mining was established in october 2009 as part of the ieee
computational intelligence society. its activities led to the international process mining
conference (icpm) series, a range of successful workshops (bpi, ataed, pods4h,
etc.), the process mining manifesto (translated into 15+ languages), the xes standard,publicly available datasets, online courses, and case studies. however, a dedicated sum-
mer school on process mining was missing. therefore, we started the preparations for
this in 2020. due to the covid-19 pandemic, this was delayed by one year, but thisgave us more time to carefully prepare this handbook on process mining.
the summer school took place in aachen, germany, during july 4–8, 2022. the
location of the summer school was the scenic superc building with nice views of thecity center and close to the cathedral of aachen, which was the ﬁrst unesco world
heritage site in germany.
the local organization was undertaken by the process and data science (pads)
group at rwth aachen university. the event was ﬁnancially supported by wil m.
p. van der aalst’s alexander von humboldt (avh) professorship. the event was also
supported by the rwth center for artiﬁcial intelligence, the center of excellenceinternet of production (iop), celonis, and springer.vi preface
the book starts with a 360-degree overview of the ﬁeld of process mining (chapter 1).
this ﬁrst chapter introduces the basic concepts, the different types of process mining,process modeling notations, and storage formats for events.
chapter 2 presents the foundations of process discovery. it starts with discovering
directly-follows graphs from simple event logs and highlighting the challenges. thenbasic bottom-up and top-down process discovery techniques are presented that produce
petri nets and bpmn models.
chapter 3 presents four additional process discovery techniques: an approach based
on state-based regions, an approach based on language-based regions, the split mining
approach, and the log skeleton-based approach.
techniques to discover declarative process models are presented in chapter 4. the
chapter focuses on discovering declarative speciﬁcations from event logs, monitor-
ing declarative speciﬁcations against running process executions to promptly detect
violations, and reasoning on declarative process speciﬁcations.
chapter 5 presents techniques for conformance checking. an overview of the appli-
cations of conformance checking and a general framework are presented. the goal is tocompare modeled and observed behavior.
chapter 6 discusses event data in more detail, also describing the data-preprocessing
pipeline, standards like xes, and data quality problems.
chapter 7 takes a more applied view and discusses how process mining is used in
different industries and the efforts involved in creating an event log. the chapter also
lists best practices, illustrated using the order-to-cash (o2c) process in an sap system.
chapter 8 introduces a number of techniques for process enhancement, including pro-
cess extension and process improvement. for example, it is shown how to add additional
perspectives to a process model.
chapter 9 introduces event knowledge graphs as a means to model multiple entities
distributed over different perspectives. it is shown how to construct, query, and aggregate
event knowledge graphs to get insights into complex behaviors.
predictive process monitoring techniques are introduced in chapter 10. this is the
branch of process mining that aims at predicting the future of ongoing (uncompleted)
process executions.
streaming process mining refers to the set of techniques and tools which have the
goal of processing a stream of data (as opposed to a ﬁxed event log). chapter 11 presentssuch techniques.
the topic of responsible process mining is addressed in chapter 12. the chapter sum-
marizes and discusses current approaches that aim to make process mining responsibleby design, using the well-known fact criteria (fairness, accuracy, conﬁdentiality, and
transparency).
chapter 13 discusses the evolution of the ﬁeld of process mining, i.e., the transi-
tion from process discovery to process execution management. the focus is on driving
business value.
chapter 14 makes the case that healthcare is a very promising application domain
for process mining with a great societal value. an overview of healthcare processes and
healthcare process data is given, followed by a discussion of common use cases.preface vii
chapter 15 shows that process mining is a valuable tool for ﬁnancial auditing. both
internal and external audits are introduced, along with the connection between the twoaudits and the application of process mining.
chapter 16 introduces a family of techniques, called robotic process mining, that
discover repetitive routines that can be automated using robotic process automation(rpa) technology.
chapter 17 concludes the book with an analysis of the current state of the process
mining discipline and outlook on future developments and challenges. pointers to thelecture material will be made available via www.process-mining-summer-school.org ,
www.processmining.org , and www.tf-pm.org . these complement this book.
finally, we thank all the participants, authors, speakers, and the organizations sup-
porting this once-in-a-lifetime event. in particular, we thank the alexander von humboldt
foundation. enjoy reading!
