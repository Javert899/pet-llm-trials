modeling digital shadows in manufacturing using process
mining

abstract: friction in shopfloor-level manufacturing processes often occurs at the intersection of
different subprocesses (e.g., joining sub-parts). therefore, considering the digital shadows (dss) of
individual materials/sub-parts is not sufficient when analyzing the processes. to this end, holistic
viewsonshopfloor-levelprocessesthatintegratemultipledssareneeded.inthiswork,wediscusshow
material-centric dss supported by discrete assembly events can be integrated using techniques from
process mining. in particular, we propose to utilize dss that contain additional structural information
to overcome the main challenges of concurrency and the presence of many different objects.

1 introduction
with the advent of industry 4.0, digital shadows (dss) become increasingly important for
decision-making in production. at the same time, companies collect increasing amounts of
data on their operational processes. despite the importance and feasibility in terms of data
availability, realizing compatible dss, which can be integrated and linked to create new
insights, often remains difficult. to facilitate the use and create a common foundation, a ds
metamodelhasbeenproposedin[be21](seefig.1).still,implementationscanbecome
veryandspecific,and,therefore,realizingdssremainsdifficult.forexample,predicting
waste for a machine can require to consider and fuse many different sensors and models.

turingprocesses—namely, dss of assembly executions anddss of sub-components/materials
composition as well as production line plans . in particular, we consider assembly execution
dss built on discrete event data (e.g., assembly activity events). to gain insights into
the production process, the ds on the assembly execution and the structural material
composition for multiple products need to be combined. to this end, we use techniques
from process mining (pm) which is an emerging discipline that leverages event data to
improve processes.
in pm, there are three major concepts: events,cases, and process models .eventsare
recordings of discrete business operations and their time of occurrence. multiple events

for integrating the dss: concurrency andobject-centricity [aa21]. sub-materials can be
assembled concurrently, and, when analyzing the performance of shopfloor-level processes,
we can consider either the sub-materials or the product as case notions. when selecting the
product as the case, the events related to its sub-materials may arbitrarily interleave; while,
when selecting the materials as the case notion, friction at the intersection of materials
remainsunnoticed.inourresearch,weinvestigatebridgingthegaptowardsacomprehensive
production model by leveraging additional sources of information—namely, structural dss
onmaterialcomposition(e.g.,billofmaterials)ortheassemblyline(e.g.,assemblyline
plans). we thereby address the following research questions:
rq1how can dynamic dss of process executions be combined with structural dss of
material composition and production lines?
rq2how can we create a performance-aware ds of a production line that reveals friction
particularly at the intersection of subassembly boundaries?
whilethefirstquestionfocusesonmodelingproductionlines,thesecondquestiontargets
the enhancement of this model such that it realizes the purposeof performance monitoring.

given event and additional structural data, a model of the manufacturing process is built.
using this model, we generate unbiased performance assessments based on real data.
within the last decade, there have been numerous works on the application of pm for
manufacturingprocesses.overviewsoverthepotentialofpmtoimprovemanufacturing

the actual dynamics distinguishes pm from classical process mapping that shows statically
aggregateddata[lo21].forexample,itcanshowdifferencesbetweenthedesignedworkflow
andtheas-isproduction[lo21].however,purelyeventdata-drivenmodeldiscoverybecomes
infeasible forlarge processes. consequently,these works resort to process-global statistics
such as the number of activities in progress or cumulative delay [pa15]. process models
are only used within limited process scopes. to analyze processes based on comprehensive
models, we exploit additional manufacturing-specific information.

this end, we leverage event data generated on the shopfloor as well as additional structural
information. conceptually, we create a new ds that combines event data-based dss of
the process executions with dss that contain structuralmaterial models (e.g., multi-level
manufacturingbillsofmaterials(m2boms)).techniquesfrompmtherebyhelpto integrate
highly dynamic event data and rather rigid structural models . in particular, using concepts

concurrency andobject-centricity [aa21]. in our research, we exploit dss that contain
additionalstructuralinformationtodisentangleshopfloor-levelmanufacturingprocesses.
such models can either be manufacturing line models that disentangle the concurrency of
assemblylinesormaterialcompositionmodels.duetophysicalconstraints,itcanusually
be assumed that the data conforms to the model (e.g., products cannot skip stations at
theconveyorbelt).forexample,in[uy20],wemodeledacarmanufacturingprocessthat

information are m2boms. m2boms organize the materials built into a product in trees.
vertices correspond to materials whose assembly depend on the assembly of their child
materials. the root vertex is the final product. depending on the product, m2boms
contain hundreds of materials. for such large processes, in particular when subparts are
assembled concurrently, automatic model discovery usually fails to find understandable
models. compared to the underlying highly-structured m2bom, the models are either
unstructured and ‘spaghetti’ or overly general. this problem is worsened by products
having similar but not necessarily equal m2boms (e.g., certain materials are optional,
or there might be a choice between different configurations). in [br21], we investigated
how m2boms can be exploited to comprehensively model manufacturing processes for
the purpose of performance analysis. we start with a collection of m2boms and, targeting
