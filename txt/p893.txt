abstract  
process mining  is an emerging discipline incorporating methods 
and tools for the analysis of system/process executions captured in 
the form of event logs [1] . traditionally process mining can be 
divided into three research areas:  discovery  (construction of 
process models from event logs), conformance checking  (finding 
log and model deviations), and enhancement  of existing process 
models with additional event log data.  
bpmn (business process model and notation) 2.0 [2] is a widely 
used process modeling notation, supported by various process 
modeling and analysis tools, and is a de -facto process modeling 
standard. using bpmn within process mining opens perspectives 
for applicability of the existing process mining techniques: for 
instance discovered process models can be analyzed or enacted 
using existing bpmn -based software, and vice versa, manually 
created models can be imported to a process mining tool, verified 
against event logs, and enhanced with additional data.  
in this work we bridge the gap between conventional process 
modeling formalisms used in the context of process mining (e.g., 
petri nets, causal nets,  process  trees ) and bpmn. for that purpose 
we developed a suite of conversion algorithms and provide formal guarantees relating the behavior of petri nets (including non-free -
choice nets) to the corresponding bpmn models (and vice versa). the derived relations are used  to enhance the bpmn models with  
information learned from the event l ogs.  
the developed conversion techniques are described in detail in [3] 
and have been implemented [4]  as a part of prom (process mining 
framework)  [5] – an open source tool for process mining and 
verified on real event log data. moreover, cases for which 
conversion algorithms give more compact process  models in  comparison with the initial m odels are identified. although the 
developed algorithms deal with basic control flow constructs only, 
they can be applied in the discovery of advanced bpmn modeling elements  [2], including subprocesses  [6-7], cancellations  [8], 
conditional branching and data objects, swimlane s, message  
flows, and others .
