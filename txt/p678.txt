process mining: x-ray your business processes
wil van der aalst , eindhoven university of technology
recent breakthroughs in process mining research make it possible to discover, analyze, and improve busi-
ness processes based on event data. activities executed by people, machines, and software leave trails in
so-called event logs . events such as entering a customer order into sap, checking in for a ﬂight, chang-
ing the dosage for a patient, and rejecting a building permit have in common that they are all recorded
by information systems. over the last decade there has been a spectacular growth of data. moreover, the
digital universe and the physical universe are becoming more and more aligned. therefore, business pro-
cesses should be managed, supported, and improved based on event data rather than subjective opinions or
obsolete experiences. the application of process mining in hundreds of organizations has shown that both
managers and users tend to overestimate their knowledge of the processes they are involved in. hence, pro-
cess mining results can be viewed as x-rays showing what is really going on inside processes. such x-rays
can be used to diagnose problems and suggest proper treatment. the practical relevance of process mining
and the interesting scientiﬁc challenges make process mining one of the “hot” topics in business process
management (bpm). this article provides an introduction to process mining by explaining the core concepts
and discussing various applications of this emerging technology.

1. process mining spectrum
process mining aims to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting
knowledge from event logs readily available in today’s information systems [aalst
2011a; 2011b]. although event data are omnipresent, organizations lack a good un-
derstanding of their actual processes. management decisions tend to be based on pow-
erpoint diagrams, local politics, or management dashboards rather than an careful
analysis of event data. the knowledge hidden in event logs cannot be turned into ac-
tionable information. advances in data mining made it possible to ﬁnd valuable pat-
terns in large datasets and to support complex decisions based on such data. however,
classical data mining problems such as classiﬁcation, clustering, regression, associ-
ation rule learning, and sequence/episode mining are notprocess-centric. therefore,
business process management (bpm) approaches tend to resort to hand-made mod-

els. process mining research aims to bridge the gap between data mining and bpm.
metaphorically, process mining can be seen as taking x-rays to diagnose/predict prob-
lems and recommend treatment.
an important driver for process mining is the incredible growth of event data
[hilbert and lopez 2011; manyika et al. 2011]. event data is everywhere – in every
sector, in every economy, in every organization, and in every home one can ﬁnd sys-
tems that log events. for less than $600, one can buy a disk drive with the capacity
to store all of the world’s music [manyika et al. 2011]. a recent study published in
science [hilbert and lopez 2011], shows that storage space grew from 2.6 optimally
compressed exabytes ( 2:61018bytes) in 1986 to 295 compressed exabytes in 2007. in
2007, 94 percent of all information storage capacity on earth was digital. the other 6
percent resided in books, magazines and other non-digital formats. this is in stark con-
trast with 1986 when only 0.8 percent of all information storage capacity was digital.
these numbers illustrate the exponential growth of data.
the further adoption of technologies such as rfid (radio frequency identiﬁcation),
location-based services, cloud computing, and sensor networks, will further accelerate
the growth of event data. however, organizations have problems effectively using such
large amounts of event data. in fact, most organizations still diagnose problems based
on ﬁction (powerpoint slides, visio diagrams, etc.) rather than facts (event data). this
is illustrated by the poor quality of process models in practice, e.g., more than 20%
of the 604 process diagrams in sap’s reference model have obvious errors and their
relation to the actual business processes supported by sap is unclear [mendling et al.
2007]. therefore, it is vital to turn the massive amounts of event data into relevant
knowledge and reliable insights. this is where process mining can help.
the growing maturity of process mining is illustrated by the process mining mani-
festo [tfpm 2012] recently released by the ieee task force on process mining . this
manifesto is supported by 53 organizations and 77 process mining experts contributed
to it. the active contributions from end-users, tool vendors, consultants, analysts, and
researchers illustrate the signiﬁcance of process mining as a bridge between data min-
ing and business process modeling.
starting point for process mining is an event log . each event in such a log refers to
anactivity (i.e., a well-deﬁned step in some process) and is related to a particular case
(i.e., a process instance ). the events belonging to a case are ordered and can be seen
as one “run” of the process. event logs may store additional information about events.
in fact, whenever possible, process mining techniques use extra information such as
theresource (i.e., person or device) executing or initiating the activity, the timestamp
of the event, or data elements recorded with the event (e.g., the size of an order).

event logs can be used to conduct three types of process mining as shown in fig. 1
[aalst 2011a]. the ﬁrst type of process mining is discovery . a discovery technique takes
an event log and produces a model without using any a-priori information. process dis-
covery is the most prominent process mining technique. for many organizations it is
surprising to see that existing techniques are indeed able to discover real processes
merely based on example behaviors recorded in event logs. the second type of process
mining is conformance . here, an existing process model is compared with an event log
of the same process. conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded
in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa. the third type of process mining is
enhancement . here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using
information about the actual process recorded in some event log. whereas conformance
checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process
mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. for instance, by using times-
tamps in the event log one can extend the model to show bottlenecks, service levels,
throughput times, and frequencies.
2. process discovery
as shown in fig. 1, the goal of process discovery is to learn a model based on some event
log. events can have all kinds of attributes (timestamps, transactional information, re-
source usage, etc.). these can all be used for process discovery. however, for simplicity,
we often represent events by activity names only. this way, a case (i.e., process in-
stance) can be represented by a trace describing a sequence of activities. consider for
example the event log shown in fig. 2 (example is taken from [aalst 2011a]). this
event log contains 1391 cases, i.e., instances of some reimbursement process. there
are 455 process instances following trace acdeh . activities are represented by a single
character: a=register request ,b=examine thoroughly ,c=examine casually ,d=
check ticket ,e=decide ,f=reinitiate request ,g=pay compensation , andh=reject
request . hence, trace acdeh models a reimbursement request that was rejected after a
registration, examination, check, and decision step. 455 cases followed this path con-
sisting of ﬁve steps, i.e., the ﬁrst line in the table corresponds to 4555 = 2275 events.
the whole log consists of 7539 events.
process discovery techniques produce process models based on event logs such as
the one shown in fig. 2. for example, the classical -algorithm produces model m1for
this log. this process model is represented as a petri net . a petri net consists of places
andtransitions . the state of a petri net, also referred to as marking , is deﬁned by the
distribution of tokens over places. a transition is enabled if each of its input places
contains a token. for example, ais enabled in the initial marking of m1, because the
only input place of acontains a token (black dot). transition einm1is only enabled if
both input places contain a token. an enabled transition may ﬁrethereby consuming
a token from each of its input places and producing a token for each of its output
places. firing ain the initial marking corresponds to removing one token from start
and producing two tokens (one for each output place). after ﬁring a, three transitions
are enabled: b,c, andd. firingbwill disable cbecause the token is removed from the
shared input place (and vice versa). transition dis concurrent with bandc, i.e., it can
ﬁre without disabling another transition. transition ebecomes enabled after dandbor
chave occurred. after executing ethree transitions become enabled: f,g, andh. these
transitions are competing for the same token thus modeling a choice. when gorhis
ﬁred, the process ends with a token in place end. iffis ﬁred, the process returns to
the state just after executing a.
note that transition dis concurrent with bandc. process mining techniques need to
be able to discover such more advanced process patterns and should not be restricted
to simple sequential processes.

1391event log
fig. 2 . one event log and four potential process models ( m1,m2,m3, andm4) aiming to describe the
observed behavior.
it is easy to check that all traces in the event log can be reproduced by m1. this
does not hold for the second process model in fig. 2. m2is only able to reproduce the
most frequent trace acdeh . the model does not ﬁtthe log well because observed traces
such asabdeg are not possible according to m2. the third model is able to reproduce
the entire event log, but m3also allows for traces such as ahandadddddddg . therefore,
we consider m3to be “underﬁtting”; too much behavior is allowed because m3clearly
overgeneralizes the observed behavior. model m4is also able to reproduce the event

log. however, the model simply encodes the example traces in the log. we call such
a model “overﬁtting” as the model does not generalize behavior beyond the observed
examples.
in recent years, powerful process mining techniques have been developed that can
automatically construct a suitable process model given an event log. the goal of such
techniques is to construct a simple model that is able to explain most of the observed
behavior without “overﬁtting” or “underﬁtting” the log.
3. conformance checking
process mining is not limited to process discovery. in fact, the discovered process is
merely the starting point for deeper analysis. as shown in fig. 1, conformance check-
ing and enhancement relate model and log. the model may have been made by hand
or discovered through process discovery. for conformance checking, the modeled be-
havior and the observed behavior (i.e., event log) are compared. when checking the
conformance of m2with respect to the log shown in fig. 2, it is easy to see that only
the 455 cases that followed acdeh can be replayed from begin to end. if we try to replay
traceacdeg , we get stuck after executing acde becausegis not enabled. if we try to
replay trace adceh , we get stuck after executing the ﬁrst step because dis not (yet)
enabled.
there are various approaches to diagnose and quantify conformance. one approach
is to ﬁnd an optimal alignment between each trace in the log and the most similar
behavior in the model. consider for example process model m1, a ﬁtting trace 1=
adceg , a non-ﬁtting trace 2=abefdeg , and the following three alignments:
1=adceg
adcegand2=abefdeg
abdefdbegand3=abefdeg
abdeg
1shows a perfect alignment between 1andm1: all moves of the trace in the event
log (top part of alignment) can be followed by moves of the model (bottom part of align-
ment).2shows an optimal alignment for trace 2in the event log and model m1. the
ﬁrst two moves of the trace in the event log can be followed by the model. however, eis
not enabled after executing just aandb. in the third position of alignment 2, we see
admove of the model that is not synchronized with a move in the event log. a move
in just the model is denoted as (;d). in the next three moves model and log agree. in
the seventh position of alignment 2there is just a move of the model and not a move
in the log: (;b).3shows another optimal alignment for trace 2. here there are two
situations where log and model do not move together: (e;)and (f;). alignments 2
and3are both optimal if the penalties for “move in log” and “move in model” are the
same. in both alignments there are two steps and there are no alignments with less
than two steps.
conformance can be viewed from two angles: (a) the model does not capture the
real behavior (“the model is wrong”) and (b) reality deviates from the desired model
“the event log is wrong”). the ﬁrst viewpoint is taken when the model is supposed to
bedescriptive , i.e., capture or predict reality. the second viewpoint is taken when the
model is normative , i.e., used to inﬂuence or control reality.
there are various types of conformance and creating an alignment between log and
model is just the starting point for conformance checking [aalst 2011a]. for example,
there are various ﬁtness (the ability to replay) metrics. a model has ﬁtness 1 if all
traces can be replayed from begin to end. a model has ﬁtness 0 if model and event log
“disagree” on all events. process models m1,m3andm4have a ﬁtness of 1 (i.e., perfect
ﬁtness) with respect to the event log shown in fig. 2. model m2has a ﬁtness 0.8 for the
event log consisting of 1391 cases. intuitively, this means that 80% of the events in the
log can be explained by the model. fitness is just one of several conformance metrics.
communications of the acm, vol. 99, no. 99, article 99, publication date: november 2011.99:6 w. van der aalst
experiences with conformance checking in dozens of organizations show that real-
life processes often deviate from the simpliﬁed visio or powerpoint representations
used by process analysts.
4. model enhancement
it is also possible to extend or improve an existing process model using the alignment
between event log and model. a non-ﬁtting process model can be corrected using the
diagnostics provided by the alignment. if the alignment contains many (e;)moves,
then it may make sense to allow for the skipping of activity ein the model. moreover,
event logs may contain information about resources, timestamps, and case data. for
example, an event referring to activity “register request” and case “992564” may also
have attributes describing the person that registered the request (e.g., “john”), the
time of the event (e.g., “30-11-2011:14.55”), the age of the customer (e.g., “45”), and
the claimed amount (e.g., “650 euro”). after aligning model and log it is possible to
replay the event log on the model. while replaying one can analyze these additional
attributes.

attributes in the event log can be

fig. 3 . the process model can be extended using event attributes such as timestamps, resource information,
and case data. the model also shows frequencies, e.g., 1537 times a decision was made and 930 cases were
rejected.
for example, as fig. 3 shows, it is possible to analyze waiting times in-between
activities. simply measure the time difference between causally related events and
compute basic statistics such as averages, variances, and conﬁdence intervals. this
way it is possible to identify the main bottlenecks.
information about resources can be used to discover roles, i.e., groups of people fre-
quently executing related activities. here, standard clustering techniques can be used.
it is also possible to construct social networks based on the ﬂow of work and analyze
resource performance (e.g., the relation between workload and service times).
standard classiﬁcation techniques can be used to analyze the decision points in the
process model. for example, activity e(“decide”) has three possible outcomes (“pay”,
“reject”, and “redo”). using the data known about the case prior to the decision, we can
construct a decision tree explaining the observed behavior.

figure 3 illustrates that process mining is not limited to control-ﬂow discovery.
moreover, process mining is not restricted to ofﬂine analysis and can also be used
for predictions and recommendations at runtime. for example, the completion time of
a partially handled customer order can be predicted using a discovered process model
with timing information.
5. process mining creates value in several ways
after introducing the three types of process mining using a small example, we now
focus on the practical value of process mining. as mentioned earlier, process mining
is driven by the exponential growth of event data. for example, according to mgi,
enterprises stored more than 7 exabytes of new data on disk drives in 2010 while con-
sumers stored more than 6 exabytes of new data on devices such as pcs and notebooks
[manyika et al. 2011].
in the remainder, we will show that process mining can provide value in several
ways. to illustrate this we refer to case studies where we used our open-source soft-
ware package prom [aalst 2011a]. prom was created and is maintained by the process
mining group at eindhoven university of technology. however, research groups from
all over the world contributed to it, e.g., university of padua, universitat polit `ecnica
de catalunya, university of calabria, humboldt-universit ¨at zu berlin, queensland
university of technology, technical university of lisbon, vienna university of eco-
nomics and business, ulsan national institute of science and technology, k.u. leu-
ven, tsinghua university, and university of innsbruck. besides prom there are about
10 commercial software vendors providing process mining software (often embedded in
larger tools), e.g., pallas athena, software ag, futura process intelligence, fluxicon,
businesscape, iontas/verint, fujitsu, and stereologic.
5.1. provide insights
in the last decade, we have applied our process mining software prom in over 100 or-
ganizations. examples are municipalities (about 20 in total, e.g., alkmaar, heusden,
and harderwijk), government agencies (e.g., rijkswaterstaat, centraal justitieel in-
casso bureau, and the dutch justice department), insurance related agencies (e.g.,
uwv), banks (e.g., ing bank), hospitals (e.g., amc hospital and catharina hospital),
multinationals (e.g., dsm and deloitte), high-tech system manufacturers and their
customers (e.g., philips healthcare, asml, ricoh, and thales), and media companies
(e.g., winkwaves). for each of these organizations, we discovered some of their pro-
cesses based on the event data they provided. in each discovered process, there were
parts that surprised some of the stakeholders. the variability of processes is typically
much bigger than expected. such insights represent a tremendous value as surprising
differences often point to waste and mismanagement.
5.2. improve performance
as explained earlier, it is possible to replay event logs on discovered or hand-made
process models. this can be used for conformance checking and model enhancement.
since most event logs contain timestamps, replay can be used to extend the model with
performance information.
figure 4 illustrates some of the performance-related diagnostics that can be obtained
through process mining. the model shown was discovered based on 745 objections
against the so-called woz (“waardering onroerende zaken”) valuation in a dutch mu-
nicipality. dutch municipalities need to estimate the value of houses and apartments.
the woz value is used as a basis for determining the real-estate property tax. the
higher the woz value, the more tax the owner needs to pay. therefore, many citizens
appeal against the woz valuation and assert that it is too high.

fig. 4 . performance analysis based on 745 appeals against the woz valuation.
each of the 745 objections corresponds to a process instance. together these in-
stances generated 9583 events all having timestamps. figure 4 shows the frequency of
the different paths in the model. moreover, the different stages of the model are colored
to show where, on average, most time is spent. the purple stages of the process take
most time whereas the blue stages take the least time. it is also possible to select two
activities and measure the time that passes in-between these activities. as shown in
fig. 4, on average, 202.73 days pass in-between the completion of activity “oz02 voor-
bereiden” (preparation) and the completion of “oz16 uitspraak” (ﬁnal judgment). this
is longer than the average overall ﬂow time which is approx. 178 days. about 416 of
the objections (approx. 56%) follow this route; the other cases follow the branch “oz15
zelf uitspraak” which, on average, takes less time.
diagnostics as shown in fig. 4 can be used to improve processes by removing bot-
tlenecks and rerouting cases. since the model is connected to event data, it is possible
to “drill down” immediately and investigate groups of cases that take more time than
others [aalst 2011a].
5.3. ensure conformance
replay can also be used to check conformance as is illustrated by fig. 5. based on
745 appeals against the woz valuation, we also compared the normative model and
the observed behavior: 628 of the 745 cases can be replayed without encountering any
problems. the ﬁtness of the model and log is 0.98876214 indicating that almost all
recorded events are explained by the model. despite the good ﬁtness, prom clearly
shows all deviations. for example, “oz12 hertaxeren” (reevaluate property) occurred
23 times while this was not allowed according to the normative model (indicated by
the “-23” in fig. 5). again it is easy to “drill down” and see what these cases have in
common.
the conformance of the appeal process just described is very high (about 99% of
events are possible according to the model). we also encountered many processes with
communications of the acm, vol. 99, no. 99, article 99, publication date: november 2011.process mining: x-ray y our business processes 99:9

was executed once while not

and for two cases oz16 was not

fig. 5 . conformance analysis showing deviations between event log and process model.
a very low conformance, e.g., it is not uncommon to ﬁnd processes where only 40% of
the events are possible according to the model. for example, process mining revealed
that asml’s modeled test process strongly deviated from the real process [rozinat
et al. 2009].
the increased importance of corporate governance, risk and compliance manage-
ment, and legislation such as the sarbanes-oxley act (sox) and the basel ii accord,
illustrate the practical relevance of conformance checking. process mining can help au-
ditors to check whether processes are executed within certain boundaries set by man-
agers, governments, and other stakeholders [aalst et al. 2010]. violations discovered
through process mining may indicate fraud, malpractice, risks, and inefﬁciencies. for
example, in the municipality where we analyzed the woz appeal process, we discov-
ered misconﬁgurations of their eistream workﬂow management system. people also
bypassed the system. this was possible because system administrators could manu-
ally change the status of cases [rozinat and aalst 2008].
5.4. show variability
hand-made process models tend to provide an idealized view on the business process
that is modeled. often such a “powerpoint reality” has little in common with the real
processes that have much more variability. however, to improve conformance and per-
formance, one should not abstract away this variability.
in the context of process mining we often see spaghetti-like models such as the one
shown in fig. 6. the model was discovered based on an event log containing 24331
events referring to 376 different activities. the event log describes the diagnosis and
treatment of 627 gynecological oncology patients in the amc hospital in amsterdam.
the spaghetti-like structures are not caused by the discovery algorithm but by the
true variability of the process.
although it is important to confront stakeholders with the reality as shown in fig. 6,
we can also seamlessly simplify spaghetti-like models. just like using electronic maps
it is possible to seamlessly zoom in and out [aalst 2011a]. while zooming out, insignif-
icant things are either left out or dynamically clustered into aggregate shapes – like

5.5. improve reliability
process mining can also be used to improve the reliability of systems and processes. for
example, since 2007 we have been involved in an ongoing effort to analyze the event
logs of the x-ray machines of philips healthcare using process mining [aalst 2011a].
these machines record massive amounts of events. for medical equipment it is es-
sential to prove that the system was tested under realistic circumstances. therefore,
process discovery was used to construct realistic test proﬁles. philips healthcare also
used process mining for fault diagnosis. by learning from earlier problems, it is possi-
ble to ﬁnd the root cause for new problems that emerge. for example, using prom, we
have analyzed under which circumstances particular components are replaced. this
resulted in a set of signatures. when a malfunctioning x-ray machine exhibits a par-
ticular “signature” behavior, the service engineer knows what component to replace.
5.6. enable prediction
the combination of historic event data with real-time event data can also be used to
predict problems. for instance, philips healthcare can anticipate that an x-ray tube
in the ﬁeld is about to fail by discovering patterns in event logs. hence, the tube can
be replaced before the machine starts to malfunction.

today, many data sources are updated in (near) real-time and sufﬁcient computing
power is available to analyze events as they occur. therefore, process mining is not
restricted to off-line analysis and can also be used for online operational support. for
a running process instance it is possible to make predictions such as the expected
remaining ﬂow time [aalst 2011a].
6. conclusion
process mining techniques enable organizations to x-ray their business processes, di-
agnose problems, and get suggestions for treatment. process discovery often provides
new and surprising insights. these can be used to redesign processes or improve man-
agement. conformance checking can be used to see where processes deviate. this is
very relevant as organizations are required to put more emphasis on corporate gover-
nance, risks, and compliance. process mining techniques offer a means to more rigor-
ously check compliance while improving performance.
this article introduced the basic concepts and showed that process mining can pro-
vide value in several ways. the reader interested in process mining is referred to the
ﬁrst book on process mining [aalst 2011a] and the process mining manifesto [tfpm
2012] which is available in 12 languages. also visit www.processmining.org for sample
logs, videos, slides, articles, and software.
