this volume constitutes the proceedings of the 38th international conference on
application and theory of petri nets and concurrency (petri nets 2017). this series of
conferences serves as an annual meeting place to discuss progress in the ﬁeld of petri
nets and related models of concurrency. these conferences provide a forum forresearchers to present and discuss both applications and theoretical developments inthis area. novel tools and substantial enhancements to existing tools can also bepresented. this year, the satellite program of the conference comprised ﬁve workshops,
two petri net courses, two advanced tutorials, and a model-checking contest.
petri nets 2017 was colocated with the application of concurrency to system
design conference (acsd 2017). both were organized by the arag ón institute of
engineering research of zaragoza university. the conference took place at the school
of engineering and architecture of zaragoza university during june 25 –30, 2017. we
would like to express our deepest thanks to the organizing committee chaired by jos é
manuel colom for the time and effort invested in the local organization of this event.
this year, 33 papers were submitted to petri nets 2016 by authors from 25 different
countries. each paper was reviewed by three reviewers. the discussion phase and ﬁnal
selection process by the program committee (pc) were supported by the easychairconference system. the pc selected 16 papers for presentation: nine theory papers, four
application papers, and three tool papers. the number of submissions was a bit lower
than expected. however, we were pleased that several highly innovative and verystrong papers were submitted. after the conference, some of these authors were invitedto submit an extended version of their contribution for consideration in a special issueof a journal.
we thank the pc members and other reviewers for their careful and timely evalu-
ation of the submissions and the fruitful constructive discussions that resulted in theﬁnal selection of papers. the springer lncs team (notably anna kramer and alfred
hofmann) and uli schlachter provided excellent and welcome support in the prepa-
ration of this volume. we are also grateful to the invited speakers for theircontributions:
–thomas henzinger, institute of science and technology (ist) austria, who
delivered the distinguished carl adam petri lecture
“promises and challenges of reactive modeling: a personal perspective ”
–josep carmona, universitat polit ècnica de catalunya, barcelona, spain

“complexity made simple (at a small price) ”
–irina lomazova, national research university higher school of economics,

“resource equivalences in petri nets ”alongside acsd 2017, the following workshops were colocated: the workshop on
petri nets and software engineering (pnse 2017), the workshop on modeling andsoftware engineering in business and industry (mosebin 2017), the workshop onalgorithms and theories for the analysis of event data (ataed 2017), the workshop
on structure theory of petri nets (structure 2017), and the workshop on
healthcare management and patient safety through modelling and simulation. othercolocated events included: the model checking contest, the petri net course, and anadvanced tutorial on process mining (a tour in process mining: from practice toalgorithmic challenges).
we hope you will enjoy reading the contributions in this lncs volume.

abstract. reactive models offer a fundamental paradigm for predicting the
behavior of highly concurrent event-based systems, which includes all systemswith signi ﬁcant software components. while much historical emphasis has been
put on the analysis and comparison of different models for concurrency, several
additional capabilities of reactive models have come into focus more recently:
the heterogeneous combination of computational and analytical models, ofworst-case and best-effort techniques; interface languages for the decomposition
of a system into multiple viewpoints, in addition to temporal, spatial, and
hierarchical structuring mechanisms; reasoning about strategic choice, in addi-tion to non-deterministic and probabilistic choice; computing quantitative ﬁtness
measures vis- à-vis boolean requirements, in addition to measures of time and
resource consumption; design for robustness properties, in addition to correct-ness and performance properties; theories of approximation in addition to the-
ories of abstraction; methods for system synthesis in addition to model analysis.
we review some results and outline some challenges on these topics.
