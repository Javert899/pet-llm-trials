abstract. alfred hofmann has been responsible for our lecture notes
in computer science (lncs) series for over 30 years. during these years
the eld of computer science changed dramatically. first of all, computer
science has become much more important. this is reected by the number
of lncs volumes per year growing from a handful per year to over
600 volumes per year. second, computer science broadened its scope
and now also includes topics such as data science and business process
management. alfred hofmann dedicated his career to lncs and helped
to create a publication channel for both established and upcoming elds.
for example, the business process management (bpm) conference series
was published in lncs right from the start in 2003. to celebrate alfred's
contributions, i reect on lncs from a bpm perspective.

1 introduction
i'm happy to contribute to this \commemorative publication", celebrating alfred
hofmann's contributions to the lecture notes in computer science (lncs)
series over the last 30 years. lncs was established in 1973. in the rst years there
were only a dozen lncs volumes per year. when alfred took over, less than
100 were published per year and there were discussions to stop the lncs series.
thanks to his eorts, lncs expanded impressively. alfred traveled around the
world for almost 30 years to promote the lncs series. in 2016, the milestone of
10.000 volumes was reached. currently, there are over 12.000 lncs volumes with
around 600 being added each year. these include transactions subseries such as
\petri nets and other models of concurrency" (topnoc) and topical subseries
such as \lecture notes in articial intelligence" (lnai) and lecture notes in
bioinformatics (lnbi). there are also \sister series" such as \lecture notes in
business information processing" (lnbip), where i'm one of the editors.
i have organized many conferences and workshops published by springer in
lncs (and also lnbip). this always required the approval of alfred. he would
send an e-mail with the topic \conference xyz { lncs: okay!". compared to2 wil van der aalst
other publishers (e.g., ieee) these processes were always smooth and handed in
a professional manner. the conditions would always be crystal clear and what
was promised also happened. this enables researchers to focus on the content.
in the remainder, i briey reect on the development of lncs from a personal
perspective. i will also sketch how the business process management (bpm)
conference series emerged from the petri net conference series. the proceedings
of both conference series appeared in lncs over the last 40 years.
2 petri nets and lncs
i have organized the petri net conference twice (2003 in eindhoven and 2019
in aachen) and was two times program chair [2, 3, 7]. the conference in aachen
last year (june 2019), was the 40th conference. renowned speakers reected on
the rich history of petri net research.
in 1979, the advanced course on general net theory of processes and sys-
tems took place in hamburg, resulting in the 84th lncs volume published in
1980 [6]. recall that lncs was established in 1973. hence, the volume num-
ber of [6] (i.e., 84) shows that in the beginning, there were just a handful of
lncs volumes per year. the success of the advanced course in 1979 was the
trigger to create the \european workshop on application and theory of petri
nets" series, which started in strasbourg in 1980. the series was rst renamed
to \international conference on applications and theory of petri nets" and
later to \international conference on application and theory of petri nets and
concurrency". initially, there were informal proceedings combined with periodic
\advances in petri nets". the lncs numbers (following 84) are 188, 222, 254,
255, 266, 340, 424, 483, 524, 609, 616, 674, 691, 815, 935, 1091, 1248, 1420, 1639,
1825, 2075, 2360, 2679, 3099, 3536, 4024, 4546, 5062, 5606, 6128, 6709, 7347,
7927, 8498, 9115, 9698, 10258, 10877, and 11522. the larger distances between
the volume numbers in the last 15 years show the success of alfred hofmann's
eorts.
the focus of the petri net conference is mostly on the theoretical aspects of
concurrency theory and process models. however, computer science developed,
leading to the uptake of topics such as machine learning, articial intelligence,
data science, process mining, service orientation, cloud computing, and business
process management.
3 business process management and lncs
the rst business process management (bpm) conference took place in june
2003 in eindhoven [5]. i initiated the bpm conference for several reasons. first of
all, i wanted to have a co-located event complementing the petri net conference,
i was also organizing that year. second, i felt that the topic of bpm deserved
its own conference. many bpm researchers were using petri nets. however, their
work did not t well into the petri net conference where there was little appreci-
ation for more systems-oriented research (e.g., building workow systems). thehow lncs helped to shape the field of business process management 3
bpm conference was an immediate success and all of its proceedings have been
published in lncs.
before the bpm conference series started, i already edited an lncs volume
on business process management (bpm) with j org desel and andreas oberweis
[4]. this helped to identify the key players in the eld. according to springerlink
there were around 80 bpm publications in 2000. in 2019 there were 1200 bpm
publications showing the development of the eld.
the workshop proceedings of the bpm conference are published in \lecture
notes in business information processing" (lnbip), a series managed by ralf
gerstner, a close colleague of alfred. ralf played a crucial role in strengthening
the position of springer as a key publisher for bpm research.
at the bpm conference in 2012, i gave a keynote reecting on a decade of
bpm conferences [1]. in the keynote, i presented a systematic analysis of the
topics covered by the papers published in the bpm proceedings and identied 20
use cases and six key concerns: process modeling languages, process enactment
infrastructures, process model analysis, process mining, process exibility, and
process reuse. i also predicted the uptake of more data-driven bpm approaches
(such as process mining) that can be witnessed today.
4 conclusion
europe is still leading in both petri nets and bpm. for example, there are
fewer researchers in the usa working on \processes", and most innovations in
bpm (e.g., novel process mining techniques) have european roots. both tradi-
tional software providers such as sap and software ag and upcoming software
providers such as celonis and signavio benet from these roots. lncs has a
similar european avor, thus nicely complementing ieee and acm.
i guess that i published over 200 papers in lncs and another 100 in \sister
series" such as lnbip. my colleagues and me are grateful for the support given
by springer over the last 40 years. on behalf of the broader bpm community, i
like to thank alfred hofmann for his eorts in building lncs series!
