process mining techniques enable the analysis of a wide variety of processes
using event data. among the available process mining techniques, most
consider a single process perspective at a time—in the shape of a model or
log. in this paper, we have developed a tool that can compare and visualize
the same process under different constraints, allowing to analyze multiple
aspects of the process. we describe the architecture, structure and use of the
tool, and we provide an open-source full implementation.

1 introduction
many companies today are unaware of why their processes are not
performing at the maximum capacity, what are the bottlenecks in
their processes, and which are the root causes of such performance
issues. process mining enables early detection of such problems,
and allows companies to use it for monitoring and optimizing their
process.
comparing the behavior of a process under different circum-
stances, like time and other parameters, can help in identifying
the causes of differences in models and performance. particularly,
comparative process mining aims at finding differences between
two processes, and to detect process-related issues. comparing the
behaviour of two processes can help to investigate why one of them
performs better in terms of predetermined characteristics or key per-
formance indicators, to extract patterns or additional information,
and to improve the understanding of these processes.

there exist two variants of process comparison: model-based
or log-based comparison. the former uses models as input, while
the latter considers event logs. model-based comparison [cordes
et al.2014; ivanov et al .2015; la rosa et al .2013] is based on the
control-flow dimension, and focuses on comparing the similarity
of the input models. model-based comparison techniques start by
extracting a model from an event log through process discovery,
and then check what activities are present in all models, or absent in
one of them. often, color coding or thickness of arcs and activities
is used to highlight (significant) differences. the main drawback
of model-based comparison is that the comparison is based mostly
on the structure of the input models. it is not possible to analyze
other process metrics (e.g., frequency or time statistics). log-based
comparisons do not have such limitation. for example, in [van beest
et al.2016], the proposed framework allows comparing the event
logs of two processes. such framework constructs a transition sys-
tem based on the two-input event logs and provides process metrics.
the coloring allows a user to quickly see where the differences of
the two input event logs lie. in [van der aalst et al .2013], the authors
propose a comparative analysis using process cubes. each cell in
the cube corresponds to a set of events that can be used to discover
a process model, to check conformance, or to discover bottlenecks.
slicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down, enable viewing event data
from different angles and produce results that can be compared.
the purpose of our log-based comparison tool is to derive a
way in which one can visualize the business process under certain
conditions. moreover, it also helps in comparing process models

generated to find patterns and additional information to have a
better understanding of the process.
the remainder of this paper is structured as follows. in section 2,
we describe the tool, its functions, and its architecture. then, sec-
tion 3 concludes this paper.
2 architecture and description
the high-level architecture of the tool is shown in figure 1. the tool
is build on python 3.8 and django framework. pm4py 2.7.7.1 grants
the core process mining functionalities, such as import/export of
logs and models. we obtain directly-follows graph (dfg) models
and visualize them using the g6 library.
the tool allows the users to upload and/or select an event log
from the root directory of event logs. in the comparison window, we
provide users with the ability to choose a column and its attributes,
which will be used to filter the log for variants satisfying the criteria.
users can choose what they wishes to visualize and compare. a
common discovery algorithm will be applied to the variants, and
once the models are generated, these will be analyzed to identify
unique activities and edges. unique elements in an activity will
be highlighted so the user is easily able to identify comparative
information. we also provide statistics such as number of traces,
cases and average running time of the variants, and will be displayed
to the user between the two filtered variants model. there, users can
export the complete comparison information as pdf or can choose
to export the individual components, like export variants, logs, or
dfgs individually. the user may also add more models, although the
comparison is limited to two models. the red colored activities in
the model signify that these activities are not common between the
models. the models can be visualized in performance or frequency
metrics. figure 2 shows the comparison of a given process at two
different time intervals. it also highlights the activities that are not
common in both the models.
the implementation and user manual of the tool are available
on github1. a video is also available2. we have used a covid-19

(covas) [pegoraro et al .2021] to demonstrate the tool. in this
demonstration, we have compared the models in two different time
ranges. figure 2 shows the process model followed in uniklinikum,
aachen for the first two waves of covid-19.
3 conclusion and future work
in this paper, we presented our comparative process mining tool
built on the existing pm4py framework. this tool will enable the
research community to compare the behavior of processes in terms
of performance or frequency and derive ideal and baseline models.
as future work, we plan to enable comparing more than two models.
