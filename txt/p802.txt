abstract. the two most prominent process mining tasks are process discovery (i.e., learning a pro-
cess model from an event log) and conformance checking (i.e., diagnosing and quantifying differ-
ences between observed and modeled behavior). the increasing availability of event data makes
these tasks highly relevant for process analysis and improvement. therefore, process mining is con-
sidered to be one of the key technologies for business process management (bpm). however, as
event logs and process models grow, process mining becomes more challenging. therefore, we pro-
pose an approach to decompose process mining problems into smaller problems using the notion of
passages . a passage is a pair of two non-empty sets of activities (x;y )such that the set of direct
successors of xisyand the set of direct predecessors of yisx. any petri net can be partitioned
using passages. moreover, process discovery and conformance checking can be done per passage
and the results can be aggregated. this has advantages in terms of efﬁciency and diagnostics. more-
over, passages can be used to distribute process mining problems over a network of computers.
passages are supported through prom plug-ins that automatically decompose process discovery and
conformance checking tasks.

1. introduction
the term “big data” refers to the spectacular growth of data and the potential economic value such data
has when analyzed using clever algorithms [30, 33]. the exponential growth of event data (e.g., from
2.6 exabytes in 1986 to 295 exabytes in 2007 according to [30]) provides new opportunities for process
analysis. as more and more actions of people, organizations, and devices are recorded, there are ample
opportunities to analyze processes based on the footprints they leave in event logs. in fact, the analysis of
hand-made process models will become less important given the omnipresence of event data. this is the
reason why process mining is one of the “hot” topics in business process management (bpm). process
mining aims to discover, monitor and improve real processes by extracting knowledge from event logs
readily available in today’s information systems [2].
the starting point for process mining is an event log . each event in such a log refers to an activity
(i.e., a well-deﬁned step in some process) and is related to a particular case (i.e., a process instance ). the
events belonging to a case are ordered and can be seen as one “run” of the process. it is important to
note that an event log contains only example behavior, i.e., we cannot assume that all possible runs have
been observed. in fact, an event log often contains only a fraction of the possible behavior [2].
the growing interest in process mining is illustrated by the process mining manifesto [31] recently
released by the ieee task force on process mining . this manifesto is supported by 53 organizations
and 77 process mining experts contributed to it. the active contributions from end-users, tool vendors,
consultants, analysts, and researchers illustrate the signiﬁcance of process mining as a bridge between
data mining and business process modeling.
petri nets are often used in the context of process mining. various algorithms employ petri nets as
the internal representation used for process mining. examples are the region-based process discovery
techniques [9, 17, 42, 23, 50], the algorithm [10], and various conformance checking techniques [11,
35, 36, 41]. other techniques use alternative internal representations (c-nets, heuristic nets, etc.) that
can easily be converted to (labeled) petri nets [2].
in this paper, we focus on the following two main process mining tasks:
process discovery : given an event log consisting of a collection of traces (i.e., sequences of
events), construct a petri net that “adequately” describes the observed behavior.
conformance checking : given an event log and a petri net, diagnose the differences between the
observed behavior (i.e., traces in the event log) and the modeled behavior (i.e., ﬁring sequences of
the petri net).
both tasks are formulated in terms of petri nets. however, other process notations could be used, e.g.,
bpmn models, bpel speciﬁcations, uml activity diagrams, statecharts, c-nets, heuristic nets, etc. in
fact, also different types of petri nets can be employed, e.g., safe petri nets, labeled petri nets, free-choice
petri nets, etc.
process mining problems tend to be very challenging. there are obvious challenges that also apply
to many other data mining and machine learning problems, e.g., dealing with noise, concept drift, and
the need to explore a large and complex search space. for example, event logs may contain millions
of events. moreover, there are also some speciﬁc problems that make process discovery even more
challenging:w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 3
there are no negative examples (i.e., a log shows what has happened but does not show what could
not happen);
due to concurrency, loops, and choices the search space has a complex structure and the log
typically contains only a fraction of all possible behaviors;
there is no clear relation between the size of a model and its behavior (i.e., a smaller model may
generate more or less behavior although classical analysis and evaluation methods typically assume
some monotonicity property); and
there is a need to balance between four (often) competing quality criteria (see section 4): (1) ﬁtness
(be able to generate the observed behavior), (2) simplicity (avoid large and complex models), (3)
precision (avoid “underﬁtting”), and (4) generalization (avoid “overﬁtting”).
process discovery and conformance checking are related problems. this becomes evident when
considering genetic process discovery techniques [34, 19]. in each generation of models generated by
the genetic algorithm, the conformance of every individual model in the population needs to be assessed
(the so-called ﬁtness evaluation). models that ﬁt well with the event log are used to create the next
generation of candidate models. poorly ﬁtting models are discarded. the performance of genetic process
discovery techniques will only be acceptable if dozens of conformance checks can be done per second
(on the whole event log). this illustrates the need for efﬁcient process mining techniques.
dozens of process discovery [2, 9, 10, 15, 17, 22, 23, 25, 29, 34, 42, 47, 50] and conformance check-
ing [7, 11, 12, 14, 20, 26, 29, 35, 36, 41, 46] approaches have been proposed in literature. despite the
growing maturity of these approaches, the quality and efﬁciency of existing techniques leave much to
be desired. state-of-the-art techniques still have problems dealing with large and/or complex event logs
and process models. therefore, we proposed a divide-and-conquer approach for process mining . this
approach uses a new concept: passages . a passage is a pair of two sets of activity nodes (x;y )such that
x=y(i.e., the activity nodes in xinﬂuence the enabling of the activity nodes in y) andx=y
(i.e., the activity nodes in yare inﬂuenced by the activity nodes in x). the notion of passages will be
formalized in terms of graphs and labeled petri nets. passages can be used to decompose process discov-
ery and conformance checking problems into smaller problems . by localizing process mining techniques
to passages, more reﬁned techniques can be used. assuming that the event log and process model can
be decomposed into many small passages, substantial speedups are possible. moreover, passages can
also be used to distribute process mining problems over a network of computers (e.g., a grid or cloud
infrastructure).
this paper focuses on the theoretical foundations of process mining based on passages and extends
our earlier conference paper [3] in various respects. for example, the results are generalized to a larger
class of models and different passage partitionings. moreover, we describe new prom plug-ins based on
this work and present experimental results.
the remainder is organized as follows. section 2 introduces various preliminaries (petri nets, event
logs, etc.). section 3 deﬁnes the notion of passages for arbitrary graphs and analyzes their properties.
section 4 discusses quality criteria for process mining and introduces the notion of alignments to com-
pute the level of conformance. the notion of passages is used in section 5 to decompose the overall
conformance checking problem into a set of localized conformance checking problems. section 6 shows
how the same ideas can be used for process discovery, i.e., after determining the causal structure and4 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages
related passages, the overall process discovery problem can be decomposed into a set of local process
discovery problems. section 7 shows, using a real-life event log, that dividing the problem into smaller
problems using passages may indeed lead to signiﬁcant speedups. section 8 describes some of the prom
plug-ins that use passages to decompose process mining tasks into smaller tasks handled by conventional
algorithms. related work is discussed in section 9. section 10 concludes the paper.
2. preliminaries
this section introduces basic concepts related to graphs, petri nets and event logs.
2.1. graphs and paths
first, we introduce basic graphs notations. we will use graphs to represent process models (i.e., petri
nets) and the causal structure (also referred to as “skeleton”) of processes.
deﬁnition 2.1. (graph)
a graph is a pair g= (n;e )comprising a set nof nodes and a set ennof edges.
for a graph g= (n;e )andn2n, we deﬁne presetgn=fn02nj(n0;n)2eg(direct
predecessors) and postset ng=fn02nj(n;n0)2eg(direct successors). this can be generalized to
sets, i.e., for xn:gx=s
n2xgnandxg=s
n2xng. the superscript gcan be omitted if
the graph is clear from the context.
sequences are used to represent paths in a graph and traces in an event log. as deﬁned next, 11
is the concatenation of two sequences and xis the projection of onx, e.g.,ha;b;c;c;b;aifa;bg=
ha;b;b;ai.
deﬁnition 2.2. (sequences)
letabe a set.=ha1;a2;:::;ani2adenotes a sequence overaof lengthn. for1;22a:
12is the concatenation of two sequences, e.g., haihb;ci=ha;b;ci.xis the projection ofon
xa, i.e.,x2a!xand is deﬁned recursively: (1) hix=hi, (2) fora2xand2a:
(hai)x=haix, and (3) for a2anxand2a:(hai)x=x.
a path in a graph is a sequence of nodes connected through edges. we use the notation x:e0#q yto
state that there is a non-empty path from nodexto nodeyusing edges in e0not visiting any nodes in
q.
deﬁnition 2.3. (path)
letg= (n;e )be a graph,x;y2n,e0e, andqn.x:e0#q yif and only if is a sequence
such that=hn1;n2;:::nki,k >1,x=n1,y=nk, for all 1i < k :(ni;ni+1)2e0, and for all
1<i<k :ni62q. derived notations:
xe0#q yif and only if there exists a sequence such thatx:e0#q y,
nodes (xe0#q y) =fn2j2n^x:e0#q yg, and
forx;yn:nodes (xe0#q y) =s
(x;y)2xynodes (xe0#q y).w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 5
consider the graph g= (n;e )in fig. 2 which is later used to introduce the notion of passages. ae#q i
holds forq=fb;d;e;ggbecause of the path =ha;c;f;h;ii.ae#q idoes not hold if q=fg;hg
because all paths connecting atoineed to visit gorh. ifq=fd;e;gg, then nodes (ae#q i) =
fa;b;c;f;h;igbecause of the two paths connecting atoinot visiting any of the nodes in q.
2.2. multisets
multisets are used to represent the state of a petri net and to describe event logs where the same trace
may appear multiple times.
b(a)is the set of all ﬁnite multisets over some set a. for some multiset b2b(a),b(a)denotes the
number of times element a2aappears inb. some examples: b1= [ ] ,b2= [x;x;y ],b3= [x;y;z ],
b4= [x;x;y;x;y;z ],b5= [x3;y2;z]are multisets over a=fx;y;zg.b1is the empty multiset, b2and
b3both consist of three elements, and b4=b5, i.e., the ordering of elements is irrelevant and a more
compact notation may be used for repeating elements.
the standard set operators can be extended to multisets, e.g., x2b2,b2]b3=b4, andb5nb2=b3.
jbjis the size of multiset b, e.g.,jb1j= 0 andjb5j= 6.fa2bgdenotes the set with all elements afor
whichb(a)1.
let=ha1;a2;:::;ani2abe a sequence and b= [a1;a2;:::;an]2b(a)the corresponding
multiset.a2if and only if a2b.p
a2f(a) =p
a2bf(a) =f(a1) +f(a2) +:::+f(an)for some
functionf.
given a function f2a!band a multiset b2b(a):[f(a)ja2b]denotes the multiset over b
where element f(a)appearsp
x2ajf(x)=f(a)b(x)times.
2.3. petri nets
most of the results presented in the paper, can be adapted for various process modeling notations. how-
ever, we use petri nets to formalize the main ideas and to prove their correctness.
deﬁnition 2.4. (petri net)
apetri net is a tuple pn= (p;t;f )having a ﬁnite set of places p, a ﬁnite set of transitions t, and a
ﬂow relation f(pt)[(tp).
figure 1 shows an example petri net pn= (p;t;f )withp=fstart;c1;:::;c 5;endg,t=fa;b;
:::;hg, andf=f(start;a);(a;c1);(a;c2);:::; (h;end)g. the state of a petri net, called marking , is a
multiset of places indicating how many tokens each place contains. any m2b(p)is a marking. [start ]
is the initial marking shown in fig. 1. another potential marking is [c110;c25;c45]. this is the state with
ten tokens in c1, ﬁve tokens in c2, and ﬁve tokens in c4.
a petri net pn= (p;t;f )deﬁnes a graph (p[t;f). hence, for any x2p[t,pnx=
fyj(y;x)2fg(input nodes) and xpn=fyj(x;y)2fg(output nodes). as before, we drop the
superscript if it is clear from the context.
a transition t2tisenabled in markingm, denoted as m[ti, if each of its input places tcontains
at least one token. consider the petri net in fig. 1 with m= [c3;c4]:m[eibecause both input places
are marked.6 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages

an enabled transition tmay ﬁre, i.e., one token is removed from each of the input places tand
one token is produced for each of the output places t. formally: m0= (mnt)]tis the marking
resulting from ﬁring enabled transition tin markingm.m[tim0denotes that tis enabled in mand
ﬁringtresults in marking m0. for example, [start ][ai[c1;c2]and[c3;c4][ei[c5]for the net in fig. 1.
let=ht1;t2;:::;tni2tbe a sequence of transitions. m[im0denotes that there is a set

markingm0isreachable frommif there exists a such thatm[im0. for example, [start ][i[end]
for=ha;b;d;e;gi.
deﬁnition 2.5. (labeled petri net)
alabeled petri net pn= (p;t;f;t v)is a petri net (p;t;f )with visible transitions tvt. let
v=ht1;t2;:::;tni2t
vbe a sequence of visible transitions. m[vbm0if and only if there is a
sequence2tsuch thatm[im0and the projection of ontvyieldsv, i.e.,v=tv.
if we assume tv=fa;e;g;hgfor the petri net in fig. 1, then [start ][vb[end]forv=ha;e;e;e;e;gi
(i.e.,b,c,d, andfare invisible). note that we consider a very limited form of labeling because any event
in an event log needs to deterministically refer to a transition.
in the context of process mining, we always consider processes that start in an initial state and end
in a well-deﬁned end state. for example, given the net in fig. 1 we are interested in ﬁring sequences
starting inmi= [start ]and ending in mo= [end]. therefore, we deﬁne the notion of a system net .
deﬁnition 2.6. (system net)
a system net is a triplet sn= (pn;mi;mo)where pn= (p;t;f;t v)is a petri net with visible
transitionstv,mi2b(p)is the initial marking, and mo2b(p)is the ﬁnal marking.
given a system net, (sn)is the set of all possible visible full traces, i.e., ﬁring sequences starting in
miand ending in moprojected onto the set of visible transitions.
deﬁnition 2.7. (traces)
letsn= (pn;mi;mo)be a system net. (sn) =fvjmi[vbmogis the set of visible full traces.w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 7
in the remainder, we will simply refer to such traces as the visible traces of sn. if we assume tv=
fa;e;f;g;hgfor the petri net in fig. 1, then (sn) =fha;e;gi;ha;e;hi;ha;e;f;e;gi;ha;e;f;e;hi;
:::g.
deﬁnition 2.8. (connected)
letsn= (pn;mi;mo)with pn= (p;t;f;t v)be a system net. snisconnected if and only if
p[t=nodes (fp2migf#; fp2mog)and(sn)6=;.
in a connected system net all nodes are on a path from some initially marked place to some place marked
in the ﬁnal marking. moreover, there should be at least one trace leading from mitomo(ensured by the
requirement (sn)6=;). system nets that have no traces cannot be used for conformance checking and
are not very meaningful from a process discovery point of view. when decomposing a net into passages
we will often assume it is connected, e.g., the connectedness requirement ensures that all nodes end up
in at least one passage in theorem 5.4.
2.4. event log
as indicated earlier, event logs serve as the starting point for process mining. an event log is a multiset
oftraces . each trace describes the life-cycle of a particular case (i.e., a process instance ) in terms of the
activities executed.
deﬁnition 2.9. (trace, event log)
letabe a ﬁnite set of activities. a trace2ais a ﬁnite sequence of activities. l2b(a)is an event
log, i.e., a ﬁnite multiset of traces.
an event log is a multiset of traces because there can be multiple cases having the same trace. in this
simple deﬁnition of an event log, an event refers to just an activity . often event logs may store additional
information about events. for example, many process mining techniques use extra information such as
theresource (i.e., person or device) executing or initiating the activity, the timestamp of the event, or
data elements recorded with the event (e.g., the size of an order). in this paper, we abstract from such
information. however, the results presented in this paper can easily be extended to event logs with more
information.
an example log is l1= [ha;e;gi10;ha;e;hi5;ha;e;f;e;gi3;ha;e;f;e;hi2].l1contains informa-
tion about 20 cases, e.g., 10 cases followed trace ha;e;gi. there are 103 + 53 + 35 + 25 = 70
events in total.
the projection function x(cf. deﬁnition 2.2) is generalized to event logs, i.e., for some event log
l2b(a)and setxa:lx= [xj2l]. for example, l1fa;g;hg= [ha;gi13;ha;hi7]. note
that alleandfevents have been removed.
3. passages
to decompose large process mining problems into smaller problems, we partition process models using
the notion of passages introduced in this paper. a passage is a pair of non-empty sets of nodes (x;y )
such that the set of direct successors of xisyand the set of direct predecessors of yisx.8 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages

graph).x=fb;c;dg=fd;e;fg=yandx=fb;c;dg=fd;e;fg=y, so(x;y )is indeed
a passage.

such edges: y02y3becausey02y1(x2x1andp1is a passage) and y062y2(becausep2is a
passage and x62x2). note that if (x;y0)2e,x2x3, andy02y2, we ﬁnd a contradiction ( p2

sincex3y3,y3x3, all nodes in x3have an outgoing edge, and all nodes in y3have an

in a similar fashion it can be shown that p4=p2np1is a passage if p46= (;;;).

in a similar fashion it can be shown that p6=p1[p2is a passage. there is no need to require
p66= (;;;)because the union of two passages will always contain edges. u t

lemma 3.5. (relating passages in terms of edges)
letg= (n;e )be a graph with passages p1;p22pas(g)and letp3=p1np2,p4=p2np1,
p5=p1\p2, andp6=p1[p2. the following properties hold:
cp3=cp1ncp2,
cp4=cp2ncp1,
cp5=cp1\cp2, and
cp6=cp1[cp2.
proof:
note that the naming of passages is similar to fig. 3(a). as shown in the proof of lemma 3.3: x3=y3,
x3=y3,x4=y4,x4=y4, andx5=y5,x5=y5. moreover, x3,x4, andx5partition
x6, andy3,y4, andy5partitiony6. these properties also hold when one of more sets are empty, e.g.,
ifx3=;, then stillx3=;=;=y3. this implies that any edge in e\(x6y6)belongs to
e\(x3y3),e\(x4y4), ore\(x5y5)as sketched in fig. 3(a). the partitioning of the edges
over these three sets can be used to prove the properties listed. u t
corollary 3.6. (comparing passages in terms of edges)
letg= (n;e )be a graph with passages p1;p22pas(g). the following properties hold:
p1p2if and only if cp1cp2,
p1<p 2if and only if cp1cp2, and
p1#p2if and only if cp1\cp2=;.
to decompose process mining problems, we aim to partition a process model into smaller models using
the notion of passages. therefore, we deﬁne the notion of a passage partitioning . consider for example
the ﬁve passages shown in fig. 2. the edges in fig. 2 have numbers corresponding to the passage
they belong to, e.g., edges (a;b)and(a;c)have a label “1” showing that they belong to passage p1=
(fag;fb;cg). passagesfp1;p2;p3;p4;p5gin fig. 2 form a passage partitioning because the passages
are pairwise disjoint and together they cover all edges.w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 11

(x1;y1)(x2;y2)if and only if there is a pisuch thatf(x1;y1);(x2;y2)gbpi. it is easy to see that 
is reﬂexive (i.e., (x;y)(x;y)) , symmetric (i.e., (x1;y1)(x2;y2)if and only if (x2;y2)(x1;y1)),
and transitive (i.e., (x1;y1)(x2;y2)and(x2;y2)(x3;y3)implies (x1;y1)(x3;y3)). given

i.e., the arcs having label “2” form an equivalence class.
to prove that a passage partitioning always exists we introduce the notion of minimal passages . a
passage is minimal if it does not “contain” a smaller passage.
deﬁnition 3.8. (minimal passage)
letg= (n;e )be a graph with passages pas(g).p2pas(g)isminimal if there is no p02pas(g)
such thatp0<p.pasmin(g)is the set of minimal passages.
the ﬁve passages in fig. 2 are minimal. note that each edge belongs to precisely one minimal passage.
in fact, a minimal passage is uniquely identiﬁed by any of its elements as is shown next.
lemma 3.9. letg= (n;e )be a graph and (x;y)2e. there is precisely one minimal passage
p(x;y)= (x;y )2pasmin(g)such thatx2xandy2y.
proof:
constructp(x;y)= (x;y )as follows. initially: x:=fxgandy:=fyg. then repeat x:=x[y
andy:=y[xuntilxandydo not change anymore. the algorithm will end because there are
ﬁnitely many nodes. when it ends, x=yandy=x. hence,p(x;y)= (x;y )is a passage.
no unnecessary elements are added to xandy, so(x;y )is minimal and there is precisely one such
minimal passage for (x;y)2e.12 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages
to prove the latter one can also consider all passages q=fp1;p2;:::;pngthat contain (x;y). the
intersection of all such passagestqcontains edge (x;y)and is again a passage because of lemma 3.3.
hence,tq=p(x;y). u t
for anyf(x;y);(x0;y);(x;y0)ge:p(x;y)=p(x0;y)=p(x;y0), i.e.,p(x;y)is uniquely determined by
xandp(x;y)is also uniquely determined by y. the set of all minimal passages pasmin(g) =fp(x;y)j
(x;y)2egforms a passage partitioning.
corollary 3.10. (any graph has a passage partitioning)
any graphg= (n;e )has a passage partitioning, e.g., the set of minimal passages pasmin(g).
later we will use this corollary to partition process mining problems into smaller problems. to control
the granularity of composition it is important that passages can be combined to form larger passages (cf.
lemma 3.3) or split into minimal passages as shown by the following corollary.
corollary 3.11. (passages are composed of minimal passages)
letg= (n;e )be a graph. for any passage p2pas(g), there exists a set of minimal passages
fp1;p2;:::;pngpasmin(g)such thatp=p1[p2[:::[pn.
figure 3(b) illustrates the “fabric” of passages and the role of minimal passages. the ﬁgure shows nodes
as black dots and a few example edges are shown (just a sketch). the smaller areas correspond to minimal
passages. passage p1= (x1;y1)is composed of 8 minimal passages, p2= (x2;y2)is composed of 7
minimal passages. p5=p1\p2is composed of 3 minimal passages shared by p1andp2.p6=p1[p2
is composed of 12 minimal passages. any edge belongs to precisely one minimal passage. any node
on the left-hand side ( x1[x2) and any node on the right-hand side ( y1[y2) belongs to precisely one
minimal passage. although not shown, note that the same node may appear on both sides.
4. conformance checking
conformance checking techniques investigate how well an event log l2b(a)and a system net sn=
(pn;mi;mo)ﬁt together. note that the process model snmay have been discovered through process
mining or may have been made by hand. in any case, it is interesting to compare the observed example
behavior inland the potential behavior of sn.
conformance checking can be done for various reasons. first of all, it may be used to audit processes
to see whether reality conforms to some normative or descriptive model [8]. deviations may point to
fraud, inefﬁciencies, and poorly designed or outdated procedures. second, conformance checking can be
used to evaluate process discovery results. in fact, genetic process mining algorithms use conformance
checking to select the candidate models used to create the next generation of models [34].
there are four quality dimensions for comparing model and log: (1) ﬁtness , (2) simplicity , (3) pre-
cision , and (4) generalization [2]. a model with good ﬁtness allows for most of the behavior seen in
the event log. a model has a perfect ﬁtness if all traces in the log can be replayed by the model from
beginning to end. the simplest model that can explain the behavior seen in the log is the best model.
this principle is known as occam’s razor. fitness and simplicity alone are not sufﬁcient to judge the
quality of a discovered process model. for example, it is very easy to construct an extremely simple
petri net (“ﬂower model”) that is able to replay all traces in an event log (but also any other event logw. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 13
referring to the same set of activities). similarly, it is undesirable to have a model that only allows for
the exact behavior seen in the event log. remember that the log contains only example behavior and
that many traces that are possible may not have been seen yet. a model is precise if it does not allow
for “too much” behavior. clearly, the “ﬂower model” lacks precision. a model that is not precise is
“underﬁtting”. underﬁtting is the problem that the model over-generalizes the example behavior in the
log (i.e., the model allows for behaviors very different from what was seen in the log). at the same time,
the model should generalize and not restrict behavior to just the examples seen in the log. a model that
does not generalize is “overﬁtting”. overﬁtting is the problem that a very speciﬁc model is generated
whereas it is obvious that the log only holds example behavior (i.e., the model explains the particular
sample log, but there is a high probability that the model is unable to explain the next batch of cases).
in the remainder, we will focus on ﬁtness. however, the ideas are applicable to the other quality
dimensions.
deﬁnition 4.1. (perfectly fitting log)
letl2b(a)be an event log and let sn= (pn;mi;mo)be a system net. lperfectly ﬁts snif and
only iff2lg(sn).
note thatf2lgconverts multiset linto a set of traces. consider two event logs l1= [ha;e;gi10;
ha;e;hi5;ha;e;f;e;gi3;ha;e;f;e;hi2]andl2= [ha;e;gi10;ha;gi3;ha;a;g;e;hi2]and the system net
snof the petri net depicted in fig. 1 with tv=fa;e;f;g;hg. clearly,l1perfectly ﬁts snwhereas
l2does not. there are various ways to quantify ﬁtness [2, 7, 11, 29, 34, 35, 36, 41]. to illustrate that
conformance checking tasks can be decomposed using passages, we focus on alignments as the basis for
conformance checking.
to measure ﬁtness, one needs to align traces in the event log to traces of the process model. some
example alignments for l2andsn:
1=aeg
aeg2=ag
aeg3=aageh
aeh4=aageh
aeg
the top row of each alignment corresponds to “moves in the log” and the bottom row corresponds to
“moves in the model”. if a move in the log cannot be mimicked by a move in the model, then a “ ”
(“no move”) appears in the bottom row. for example, in 3the model is unable to do the second amove
and is unable to do gbeforee. if a move in the model cannot be mimicked by a move in the log, then a
“” (“no move”) appears in the top row. for example, in 2the log did not do an emove whereas the
model has to make this move to enable gand reach the end. given a trace in the event log, there may be
many possible alignments. to select the most appropriate one we associate costs to moves and select an
alignment with the lowest total costs.
amove is a pair (x;y)where the ﬁrst element refers to the log and the second element refers to the
model. for example, (a;a)means that both log and model make an “ amove”. (;a)means that the
model makes an “ amove” without a corresponding move of the log. (a;)means that the log makes
an “amove” not followed by the model.

clearly,3is a better alignment than 4. this can be quantiﬁed using a cost function .

moves where log and model agree have no costs, i.e., (a;a) = 0 for alla2a.(;a)>0is the
cost when the model makes an “ amove” without a corresponding move of the log. (a;)>0is the
cost for an “ amove” in just the log. these costs may depend on the nature of the activity, e.g., skipping
a payment may be more severe than sending too many letters. however, in this paper we often use a
standard cost function sthat assigns unit costs: s(a;a) = 0 ands(;a) =s(a;) = 1 for all
a2a. for example, s(1) = 0 ,s(2) = 1 ,s(3) = 2 , ands(4) = 4 (simply count the number of
symbols).
deﬁnition 4.4. (optimal alignment)
letl2b(a)be an event log and snbe a system net with (sn)6=;.

4is not an optimal alignment for trace ha;a;g;e;hiand the net in fig. 1 with tv=fa;e;f;g;hg.1,
2, and3are optimal alignments. hence, costs (l2;sn;s) = 10s(1)+3s(2)+2s(3) =
100 + 31 + 22 = 7 .
it is possible to convert misalignment costs into a ﬁtness value between 0 (poor ﬁtness, i.e., maximal
costs) and 1 (perfect ﬁtness, zero costs). we refer to [7, 11] for details. misalignment costs can be related
to deﬁnition 4.1, because only perfectly ﬁtting traces have costs 0 (assuming (sn)6=;).
lemma 4.5. (perfectly fitting log)
event loglperfectly ﬁts system net snif and only if costs (l;sn;) = 0 .
once an optimal alignment has been established for every trace in the event log, these alignments can also
be used as a basis to quantify other conformance notations such as precision and generalization [7]. for
example, precision can be computed by counting “escaping edges” as shown in [35, 36]. recent results
show that such computations should be based on alignments [13]. the same holds for generalization [7].
therefore, we focus on alignments when decomposing passages.w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 15
5. distributed conformance checking
conformance checking techniques can be time consuming as potentially many different traces need to
be aligned with a model that may allow for an exponential (or even inﬁnite) number of traces. event
logs may contain millions of events. finding the best alignment may require solving many optimization
problems [11] or repeated state-space explorations [41]. when using genetic process mining, one needs
to check the ﬁtness of every individual model in every generation [34]. as a result, thousands or even
millions of conformance checks need to be done. for each conformance check, the whole event log needs
to be traversed. given these challenges, we are interested in reducing the time needed for conformance
checking. moreover, passages can be used to provide local diagnostics (per passage).
in this section, we show that it is possible to decompose and distribute conformance checking prob-
lems using the notion of passages deﬁned in section 3. in order to do this we focus on the visible
transitions and create the so-called skeleton of the process model.
deﬁnition 5.1. (skeleton)

figure 5. the skeleton of the labeled petri net in fig. 1 (assuming that tv=fa;e;f;g;hg). there are two
minimal passages: (fa;fg;feg)and(feg;ff;g;hg).
note that only the visible transitions tvappear in the skeleton. for example, if we assume that
tv=fa;g;hgin fig. 1, then the skeleton is (fa;g;hg;f(a;g);(a;h)g)and there is only one passage
(fag;fg;hg).
if there are multiple (minimal) passages in the skeleton, then we can decompose conformance check-
ing problems into smaller problems by partitioning the petri net into net fragments and the event log into
sublogs . we will ﬁrst show that each passage (x;y )deﬁnes one net fragment pn(x;y )(cf. deﬁni-
tion 5.2) and one subloglx[y. then we will prove that conformance can be checked per passage.
consider event log l= [ha;e;gi10;ha;e;hi5;ha;e;f;e;gi3;ha;e;f;e;hi2], the petri net pnshown
in fig. 1 with tv=fa;e;f;g;hg, and the skeleton shown in fig. 5. there are two passages: p1=
(fa;fg;feg)andp2= (feg;ff;g;hg). based on this we deﬁne two net fragments pn 1andpn 2
as shown in fig. 6. moreover, we deﬁne two sublogs: l1= [ha;ei15;ha;e;f;ei5]andl2= [he;gi10;

(left) and pn 2=pn(feg;ff;g;h g)(right). the visible transitions tv=fa;e;f;g;hgthat form the boundaries of
the fragments are highlighted.
in order to prove this, we ﬁrst deﬁne the notion of a net fragment.
deﬁnition 5.2. (net fragment)
letpn= (p;t;f;t v)be a labeled petri net. for any two sets of transitions x;ytv, we deﬁne the
net fragment pn(x;y )= (p0;t0;f0;t0
v)with:
z=nodes (xf#tv y)n(x[y)are the internal nodes of the fragment,
p0=p\z,
t0= (t\z)[x[y,
f0=f\((p0t0)[(t0p0)), and
t0
v=x[y.
note that pn 1=pn(fa;fg;feg)in fig. 6 has z=fb;c;d;c 1;c2;c3;c4gas internal nodes.
now we can prove the main result of this paper. figure 7 illustrates our decomposition approach.
a larger model can be decomposed into net fragments corresponding to passages. the event log can be
decomposed in a similar manner and conformance checking can be done per passage.
the fragments corresponding to the passages are initially empty whereas the overall petri net starts in
a particular initial marking and ends in a particular ﬁnal marking. therefore, we extend the petri net and
event log to incorporate initialization and termination (cf. the dashed >and?transitions in figure 7).
deﬁnition 5.3. (extended system net and event log)
letl2b(a)be an event log and sn= (pn;mi;mo)be a system net with pn= (p;t;f;t v).
assume two fresh identiﬁers >and?to represent an artiﬁcial start ( >) and an artiﬁcial complete ( ?).

extended with with start and complete transitions.
sn= (pn;[ ];[ ])is the extended system net having empty initial and ﬁnal markings.
1here we abstract from initialization and termination. these will be addressed by adding artiﬁcial start and complete transi-
tions/events (cf. deﬁnition 5.3).w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 17

figure 7. petri net pnis decomposed into subnets pn(x;y ). the “clouds” model the internal structure of these
subnets (places but possibly also hidden transitions). due to the decomposition based on passages, one cloud
can only inﬂuence another cloud through the visible interface transitions xandy. since the visible interface
transitions are “controlled” by the event log, it is possible to check ﬁtness locally per subnet.
the initial system net will often be a wf-net [1] as shown in figure 7, i.e., there is one source place iand
one sink place owith all nodes on a path from itooandmi= [i]andmo= [o]. however, the results
presented apply to any connected net and not just wf-nets. note that deﬁnition 5.3 assumes that miand
moare safe, i.e., these two markings have at most one token per place. however, the construction can
easily be generalized by introducing arc weights. figure 8(a-b) illustrates the net extension described in
deﬁnition 5.3.
to be able to project traces onto the visible nodes of a fragment, we deﬁne the following shorthand
for a passage p= (x;y ):lp=lx[y, i.e., only the events corresponding to input or output nodes
ofpare retained in the resulting log.

proof:
note that snis connected. this implies that in pn all nodes are on a path from >to?and that all
nodes and edges in pn(i.e., also the nodes in pn) are included in at least one net fragment pnpi, i.e.,s
ipnpi=pn.
second, we argue that lperfectly ﬁts system net snif and only if lperfectly ﬁts system net sn.

a visible transition may appear in multiple passages. therefore, we divide its costs by the number of

costs (l2p2;sn2;q) = 1 + 0 = 1 , i.e., the costs of the optimal overall alignments are equal to the
sums of the costs associated to all optimal local alignments. consider for example the following overall
optimal alignment for ha;a;biand optimal local alignments for h>;a;a;b;?i:

the costs of the overall optimal alignment equals the costs of the two optimal local alignments 1

andcosts (l3p2;sn2;q) = 0:5. hence, the total costs are higher than the costs associated to the two
optimal local alignments. to understand this, consider the following optimal alignments for ha;b;c;di

may indeed be local improvements lowering the sum of the costs associated with local alignments.
theorem 5.6 shows that the sum of the costs associated to all selected optimal local alignments
(usingq) can never exceed the cost of an optimal overall alignment using . hence, it can be used
for an optimistic estimate, i.e., computing an upper bound for the overall ﬁtness and a lower bound for
the overall costs. more important, the ﬁtness values of the different passages provide valuable local
diagnostics. the passages with the highest costs are the most problematic parts of the model. the
alignments for these “problem spots” help to understand the main problems without having to look at
very long overall alignments.
theorem 5.6 shows just one of many possible deﬁnitions of ﬁtness. we can also simply count
thefraction of ﬁtting traces . in this case the problem can be decomposed easily using the notation
of passages.

proof:
follows from the construction used in theorem 5.4. a trace is ﬁtting the overall model if and only if it
ﬁts all passages. u t
as theorem 5.7 suggests, traces in the event log can be marked as ﬁtting or non-ﬁtting per passage .
these results can be merged easily and used to compute the fraction of traces ﬁtting the overall model .
although the results presented only address the notion of ﬁtness, it should be noted that alignments
are the starting point for many other types of analysis. for example, precision can be computed by
counting so-called “escaping edges” (sequences of steps allowed by the model but never happening in
the event log) [35, 36]. this can be done at the level of passages even though there is not a straightforward
manner to compute the overall precision level. note that relatively many escaping edges in a passage
suggest “underﬁtting” of that part of model. as shown in [13], alignments should be the basis for
precision analysis. therefore, the construction used in theorems 5.4 and 5.6 can be used as a starting
point. a similar approach can be used for generalization: many unique paths in a passage may indicate
“overﬁtting” of that part of the model [7].
the alignments can be used beyond conformance checking. an alignment i(see proof of the-
orem 5.6) relates observed events to occurrences of transitions of some passage pi. if the event log
contains timestamps , such alignments can be used to compute times in-between transition occurrences
(waiting times, response times, service times, etc.) as shown in [2]. this way bottlenecks can be iden-
tiﬁed. if the event log contains additional data (e.g., size of order, age of patient, or type of customer),
these local alignments can be used for decision mining [40]. for any decision point in a passage (placew. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 21
with multiple output arcs), one can create a decision tree based on the data available prior to the choice.
note that bottleneck analysis and decision point analysis provide local diagnostics and can be added to
the overall model without any problems.
assuming a process model with many passages, the time needed for conformance checking can be
reduced signiﬁcantly . there are two reasons for this. first of all, as our theorems show, larger problems
can be decomposed into sets of independent smaller problems. therefore, conformance checking can
be distributed over multiple computers. second, due to the exponential nature of most conformance
checking techniques, the time needed to solve “many smaller problems” is less than the time needed
to solve “one big problem”. existing conformance checking approaches use state-space analysis (e.g.,
in [41] the shortest path enabling a transition is computed) or optimization over all possible alignments
(e.g., in [11] the aalgorithm is used to ﬁnd the best alignment). these techniques do notscale linearly
in the number of activities. therefore, decomposition is useful even if the checks per passage are done
on a single computer. moreover, passages are not just interesting from a performance point of view: they
can also be used to pinpoint the most problematic parts of the process (also in terms of performance) and
provide localized diagnostics.
6. process discovery: divide and conquer
in the previous section, we showed that we can decompose conformance checking tasks using passages.
instead of checking the conformance of the entire event log on the entire system net, we split up the
log and the net into pairs of sublogs and net fragments, and check conformance on each of these pairs.
provided that we have a collection of passages, we can do something similar for discovery: instead of
discovering the whole system net in one go, we ﬁrst split up the log into sublogs, then discover a net
fragment for every sublog, and ﬁnally fold all net fragments into one overall system net.
our approach builds on existing process discovery algorithms. there exist dozens of algorithms –
ranging from the simple miner [10] to the more sophisticated ilp miner [50] – that discover a petri
net from an event log. for passage-based discovery, we use such an algorithm, discover a fragment per
passage, and apply deﬁnition 5.2 in reverse direction.  pdenotes the class of algorithms that can be
used to discover a petri net pn(x;y )for a passage (x;y ). in order to decompose a discovery problem
using passages, we ﬁrst need to derive a graph with causal dependencies from the event log.  cdenotes
theclass of algorithms that can be used to discover these dependencies.
deﬁnition 6.1. (  calgorithm)
letl2b(a)be an event log over a. a calgorithm is an algorithm that takes the event log l
and returns a causal structure (i.e. a graph) with nodes va, that is, ifcis a calgorithm, then
c(l) = (v;e)is a graph with va.
note that many process discovery algorithms have an initial phase deriving these dependencies by scan-
ning the event log, e.g., the >(“directly follows”), !(“causality”),k(“concurrency”), and #(“choice”)
relationships inferred by the miner [10]. the heuristics miner [48, 49] derives similar relations while
taking noise and incompleteness into account. these algorithms can easily be distributed as they simply
count basic patterns in the event log. basically, a  calgorithm takes an event log as input, and returns
a causal structure as output. optionally, the discovered causal structure can be edited before computing22 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages
the passages from it. after determining the passages, we discover a net fragment per passage using a  p
algorithm and merge the results.
deﬁnition 6.2. (  palgorithm)
letl2b(a)be an event log over aand letx;ya. a palgorithm is an algorithm that takes a
passage (x;y )and the corresponding sublog lx[yand returns a net fragment with visible transitions
x[y, that is, ifpis a palgorithm, then p(lx[y;x;y ) = (p;t;f;x[y)is a labeled petri net.
note thatc2 creturns a causal structure that may include some (but not necessarily all) activities
(va). this way, the algorithm can effectively remove, for example, infrequent activities that might
only complicate the discovery process. the resulting causal structure can be inspected and modiﬁed by
a domain expert. this domain expert can remove any causalities that she knows do not exist, and can
add any causalities that she knows are missing. after the domain expert has thus massaged the causal
structure, a passage partitioning is derived from it and used to decompose the whole event log into a
collection of sublogs.
the calgorithm operates on the whole event log, whereas we are trying to speed-up discovery
by splitting up the entire log into a collection of sublogs. however, we can use  calgorithms that are
very fast compared to more sophisticated process mining algorithms, e.g., algorithms based on state-
based regions [9, 23, 42], language-based regions [17, 50], or genetic evolution [34] are much more
time consuming. a typical example is the ilp miner [50], which creates an integer-linear programming
problem that is exponential in the size of a, that is, in the number of activities. by using a fast  c
algorithm, passages can be used to quickly split up ainto smaller sets; as a result the ilp miner can
work much faster. furthermore, the  calgorithm does not need to take the entire log into account. its
purpose is to construct a causal structure, which is more abstract and high-level, whereas the  palgorithm
needs to ﬁll in the nitty-gritty low-level details later. therefore, it may sufﬁce to use only a sample set of
traces.
after having introduced the  pand cclasses of algorithms, we now introduce our passage-based
discovery approach.
deﬁnition 6.3. (passage-based discovery)
letl2b(a)be an event log over a set of activities aand letp2 pandc2 cbe the two selected
algorithms. our passage-based discovery approach proceeds as follows:
1. extend each trace in the event log with an artiﬁcial start event >and an artiﬁcial end event ?
(f>;?g\a=;).l= [h>ih?ij2l]is the resulting log over a=f>;?g[a.
2. discover the causal structure using c.(ac;cc) =c(l)is the resulting causal structure with
f>;?gacaandccacac.
3. optional: have a domain expert inspect (and massage if needed) the causal structure (ac;cc).
(a0
c;c0

4. compute the set of minimal passages on the causal structure (a0
c;c0
c).f(x1;y1);(x2;y2);:::;
(xk;yk)g=pasmin(a0

c)is the resulting set of passages.
5. for every minimal passage (xi;yi): discover a net fragment using p.pni= (pi;ti;fi;xi[
yi) =p(lxi[yi;xi;yi)is the resulting net fragment for passage i.
6. merge the individual net fragments pniinto one overall system net. sn= (pn;mi;mo)with
pn= (p;t;f;t v)is the resulting system net, where:

1ikfi),
tv=s

mi= [in], and
mo= [out].
the log is extended by adding an artiﬁcial start event >and an artiﬁcial end event ?to every trace. this
is just a technicality to ensure that there is a clearly deﬁned start and end. note that passages can be
activated multiple times, e.g., in case of loops. therefore, we add transitions >and?and places inand
out. if there is a unique start (end) event, then there is no need to add transition >(?). ideally, the causal
structure (a0
c;c0
c)has one source node >, one sink node?, and all other nodes are on a path from >
to?(like in a wf-net [1]).
note that in step 4 minimal passages are computed since we aim to decompose the discovery problem
in as many small independent problems as possible. however, in principle any passage partitioning may
be used as illustrated by theorems 5.4, 5.6, and 5.7.
to illustrate our divide-and-conquer approach, consider the event log l= [ha;b;c;di40;hb;a;c;di35;
ha;b;c;ei30;hb;a;c;ei25;ha;b;x;di1;ha;b;ei1]. the log describes 132 cases. we ﬁrst add artiﬁcial
events as described in step 1: l= [h>;a;b;c;d;?i40;h>;b;a;c;d;?i35;h>;a;b;c;e;?i30;h>;b;a;
c;e;?i25;h>;a;b;x;d;?i1;h>;a;b;e;?i1]. then we compute the causal structure using the c2 c
algorithm of choice (step 2). assume that the causal structure shown in fig. 9 is computed. since x
occurs only once whereas the other activities occur more than 50 times, xis excluded. the same holds
for the dependency between bande. furthermore, we assume that the domain expert does not change
the causal structure (step 3).

figure 9. causal structure c(l)discovered for the extended event log having four minimal passages.
the causal structure has four minimal passages (step 4): p1= (f>g;fa;bg),p2= (fa;bg;fcg),
p3= (fcg;fd;eg), andp4= (fd;eg;f?g). based on these passages, we create four corresponding
sublogs:l1= [h>;a;bi72;h>;b;ai60],l2= [ha;b;ci70;hb;a;ci60;ha;bi2],l3= [hc;di75;hc;ei55;
hdi1;hei1], andl4= [hd;?i76;he;?i56]. one transition-bordered petri net is discovered per sublog
using thep2 palgorithm of choice (step 5). figure 10 shows the net fragments discovered per
passage. note that infrequent behavior has been discarded by p, i.e., traceha;biinl2is not possible
according to pn 2(does not end is desired end state), and traces hdiandheiinl3are not possible
according to pn 3.
in the last step of the approach, the four net fragments of fig. 10 are merged into the overall net
system shown in figure 11 (step 6). note that this net system is indeed able to replay all frequent
behavior. two of the 132 cases cannot be replayed because they were treated as noise by the selected c
andpalgorithms.
although the resulting model in figure 11 is simple and has no loops, there are no limitations with
respect to the control-ﬂow patterns used and loops can be handled without any problems. the small24 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages

example shows that we can use a divide-and-conquer approach when discovering process models. we
deliberately did not restrict ourselves to speciﬁc  cand palgorithms. the approach is generic and can
be combined with existing process discovery techniques [2, 9, 10, 15, 17, 22, 23, 25, 29, 34, 42, 47, 50].
moreover, the user can modify the causal structure to guide the discovery process.
by decomposing the overall discovery problem into a collection of smaller discovery problems, it is
possible to do a more reﬁned analysis and achieve signiﬁcant speed-ups. the calgorithm only needs
to construct an abstract causal structure. hence, it may take only a sample (say, 100 randomly chosen
traces) of the event log into account. the palgorithm is applied for every net passage, and needs to
construct a detailed net fragment. hence, it needs only to consider an event log consisting of just the
activities involved in the corresponding passage. as a result, process discovery tasks can be distributed
over a network of computers (assuming there are multiple passages). as most discovery algorithms
are exponential in the number of activities, the sequential discovery of all individual passages on one
computer is often still faster than solving one big discovery problem. if there are more minimal passages
than computers, one can merge minimal passages into aggregate passages and use these for discovery
and conformance checking (one passage per computer). however, in most situations, it will be more
efﬁcient to analyze the minimal passages sequentially.
7. empirical evaluation
in earlier sections we showed that process mining problems can be divided into smaller problems and
that by doing this, in theory, signiﬁcant speed-ups are possible. since our passage-based decomposition
approach is very general, it is not easy to evaluate this empirically. for example, we can choose from
many different process discovery algorithms. moreover, there are various algorithms that cannot beneﬁt
from a passage-based decomposition approach because they are linear in the size of the event log. for
example, the miner [10] and the heuristics miner [48] make one pass through the whole log while
counting simple metrics like direct successions. obviously such techniques will not beneﬁt from passage-w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 25

based decomposition. however, these algorithms have various limitations: they create models without
any guarantees, e.g., the resulting models may have deadlocks, have a poor ﬁtness, and be very complex
and under- or over-ﬁtting. only more expensive algorithms that replay the log and solve optimization
problems can provide such guarantees.
therefore, we use a particular setting to provide some insights into the speed-ups possible due to
passage-based decomposition. we use a particular process discovery technique that heavily relies on
conformance checking (replay). section 7.1 presents the setting for the evaluation. section 7.2 presents
the empirical results obtained. these results clearly show that without using passages we would not
be able to use the given palgorithm, whereas with using passages it can be used on real-life logs.
section 7.3 discusses the main ﬁndings.
7.1. setting
for the evaluation, we use a real-life event log2based on the bpi challenge 2012 event log [28] and
aim to discover a process model describing the most frequent behavior. this real-life log contains noise,
which we will tackle by using the heuristic miner [48]3ascalgorithm. this miner will provide us with
a heuristic net that shows generic causal relations between actions, but which does not show the speciﬁc
transitions that represent these relations. to obtain these speciﬁc transitions we will use an exhaustive
search algorithm as palgorithm. this algorithm simply iterates over all possible sets of transitions that
satisfy the causal relations, and takes in the end the set of transitions with maximal ﬁtness.
the left-hand side of figure 12 shows a passage containing six input nodes and ﬁve output nodes.
input node i2is source to two causal relations: one to io1 and one to o2. the splitting behavior of i2
can be captured by the exhaustive search algorithm in two ways: either there is an xor-split between
io1ando2, or there is an and-split to both. the splitting behavior of i1is slightly more complicated,
as it involves three causal relations. this behavior can either be captured using (1) a single xor-split,
(2) a single and-split, or (3) by a combination of an xor-split between one and an and-split for the

aalst13.xes.gz .
3for sake of completeness: we used the heuristics miner with default settings, except for relative tobest , which we set
to0, and dependency , which we set to 100.26 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages
other two, ﬁve possibilities in total.
table 1 shows the numbers of partitions (bell numbers) up to sets containing 7 relations. please note
that we explicitly partition the set of outgoing causal relations, that is, we do not allow multiple splitting
transitions to capture the same outgoing causal relation. reason for doing so is that the latter would allow
for a petri net that contains all possible splitting transitions, which would have maximal ﬁtness by default.
instead, we partition the outgoing causal relations over the splitting transitions, and try to maximize the
ﬁtness thus. mutatis mutandis, the same holds for incoming causal relations and joining transitions. as
an example, there are 52possible sets of transitions that capture the ﬁve incoming edges to the o2output
transition. in total, this particular passage would require (5222)(2522) = 8320 possible
sets of transitions. the right-hand side of figure 12 shows a possible set of transitions.
to show the effect of passages, we will mine a petri net for different log sizes ( 1%,5%,10%,50%,
and100% of the 13;087traces of the original log) and for different numbers of passages ( 20,15,10,7,
and5). table 2 shows the characteristics of the system we used to run the evaluation on. for sake of
completeness, we mention that we set the openxes shadow size to 16, which allows openxes to keep
16buckets containing event log data in memory.
the log at hand contains 20passages, of which the most complex passage requires 877ﬁtness checks,
and2062 ﬁtness checks in total. starting from these passages, we obtained less (but more complex)
passages by combining pairs of passages into single passages. as a result, we obtained situations with
15,10,7, and 5passages (see table 3). please note that the decision which passages to merge into
new passages may have a huge impact on the resulting run times. for example, if we would merge two
passages with 1and877possibilities, then the resulting passage would have 877possibilities, whereas
if we would merge passages with 300and10possibilities, the the resulting passage would have 3000
possibilities. with this in mind, we tried to merge passages that share some nodes in such a way that
the remaining number of possibilities would not rise too quickly. for example, to obtain 15passages
from the initial 20passages, we merged four passages with single-possibility passages, which does not
increase the total number of possibilities, and we allowed only a minor increase for the ﬁfth merger (from
25and5to125).
as for the situation with only 5passages it was already a challenge to discover the model using only
1%of the traces in the log, we decided to stop at 5passages. clearly, it is impossible to apply our brute-
force discovery approach to the overall log without any passages. as the results will show, the situation
where we would only have a single passage, that is, the situation where we would try an exhaustive
search for all possible transitions, would take about 3:461019ﬁtness checks, which would have taken
eras to compute even if a single ﬁtness check would take a fraction (say, a hundredth) of a second.
7.2. results
table 4 and figure 13 show the results of the evaluation. these results clearly show that the run times
are positively effected by an increase in the number of passages. for example, when using only 1 percent
of the event log, it takes 879,634 seconds (more than 10 days) to discover the process when using 5
passages whereas this only takes 873 seconds (less than a quarter) to discover the process when using 20
passages.

tiple outputs and two transitions with multiple inputs. also note that, using this technique, we were able
to mine not only the transitions that do correspond to event classes in the log, but also many transitions
that do not correspond to any event class in the log, that is, we were also able to discover many silent
transitions.
7.3. discussion of experimental results
passage-based decomposition enabled us to discover a petri net from a real-life log (based on the bpi
challenge 2012 log) using a brute-force approach. in a ﬁrst phase, we have used the heuristic miner to
extract the major causal relations from the log. in a second phase, we have split up these causal relations
into passages, and have used an exhaustive search miner to convert these causal relations into transitions.
as a result, we have obtained a petri net able to explain the mainstream behavior. the resulting net
contains 36transitions that correspond to event classes in the log, 22silent transitions, and 43places.
note that the fact that the resulting petri net contains silent transitions can be considered to be a plus,
as there are only few techniques that can both handle noise in the log and come up with these silent
transitions.w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 29

figure 14. obtained petri net30 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages
if we would not have been able to split up the causal relations into smaller parts (like the passages),
then we would have had a hard time to convert these causal relations into transitions and places, as we
would have to check 3:461019possible combinations of transitions for the entire net.
the mining of the net took almost six hours when using the complete log to check the ﬁtness for
all2062 possible transition sets for the 20passages. the fewer passages we detect, the more complex
they will be, the more possible transition sets there will be, and the more time it will take to check them
all. therefore, it is important to have as many passages as possible. in our example, our most complex
passage corresponded to 877possible transitions sets, and even this took almost six hours. hence, it is
vital to be able to break down passages into smaller passages in case the complexity of the passages is
too high. more research is needed to create so-called “approximate passages”, i.e., passages created by
inserting artiﬁcial events or by leaving out edges that are less important. obviously, there is a trade-off
between the desire to include all possible causalities and breaking down larger passages. however, since
one is often looking for understandable models that capture most of the observed behavior, it is valid to
consider such trade-offs. note that models obtained using large passages will typically contain complex
fragments that are not understandable.
in this section, we focussed on discovery. however, the brute-force approach repeatedly computes
ﬁtness. hence, the results shown in table 4 and figure 13 are also representative for conformance
checking.
8. implementation in prom
the distributed conformance checking approach presented in section 5 has been implemented as the
“replay passages” plug-in in prom 6.2, and the divide-and-conquer process discovery technique from
section 6 has been implemented as the “mine petri net using passages” plug-in. both plug-ins have been
implemented in the “passage” package, which is installed in prom 6.2 by default.
the “mine petri net using passages” plug-in is conﬁgured by selecting a c2 calgorithm and a
p2 palgorithm, a maximum size on passages, and which activities to retain in the causal structure.
prom 6.2 supports the following  calgorithms:
alpha miner returns a causal structure based on the !(“causality”) relation constructed by the 
miner [10].
basic log relations constructs basic log relations (similar to those used by the miner) from the event
log and derives a causal structure from these relations.
heuristics miner returns a causal structure using the heuristics miner [48, 49]. the user is allowed to
conﬁgure the heuristics miner in the usual way (e.g., set thresholds for deriving causalities).
flower miner creates a causal structure which results in two passages: one passage containing only
the start (>) and complete (?) events, and one passage containing all other (i.e., original) events.
this algorithm allows one to run the chosen  palgorithm on the original log (as the second passage
contains all events from the original, i.e., not extended, log).
flower and ilp miner with proper completion first creates the two passages like the previous algo-
rithm, then runs the ilp miner (with the proper completion option selected) on the second passage,
and derives a causal structure from the mined net.
and the following  palgorithms4:
4the exhaustive miner as used in section 7 is not included in prom 6.2, but is included as the exhaustive miner in the prom 6w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 31
alpha miner returns a petri net fragment per passage by applying the miner [10] to each sublog.
ilp miner returns a petri net fragment per passage by applying the ilp miner [50] to each sublog
(using the default conﬁguration).
ilp miner with proper completion returns a petri net fragment per passage by applying the ilp
miner [50] to each sublog (with the proper completion option selected).
the maximum passage size determines for which passages the  palgorithm is used: if the size of a
passage (jx[yjfor a passage (x;y )) exceeds this threshold, then a dummy net fragment containing
only a transition for every event (i.e, no places) is constructed, otherwise the  palgorithm is used to mine
the net fragment. however, if this size is set to 0, then no maximum size applies, i.e., the  palgorithm is
used to mine every net fragment.
the current implementation does not allow for the interactive editing of the causal structure. the
domain expert can only inspect the causal structure and select the set of activities to retain. after the
plug-in has been conﬁgured, the passage-based discovery approach described in deﬁnition 6.3 is used to
construct the overall process model.
9. related work
for an introduction to process mining we refer to [2]. for an overview of best practices and challenges,
we refer to the process mining manifesto [31]. the goal of this paper is to decompose challenging
process discovery and conformance checking problems into smaller problems [4]. therefore, we ﬁrst
review some of the techniques available for process discovery and conformance checking.
process discovery, i.e., discovering a process model from a multiset of example traces, is a very chal-
lenging problem and various discovery techniques have been proposed [9, 10, 15, 17, 22, 23, 25, 29, 34,
42, 47, 50]. many of these techniques use petri nets during the discovery process and/or to represent the
discovered model. it is impossible to provide a complete overview of all techniques here. very differ-
ent approaches are used, e.g., heuristics [25, 47], inductive logic programming [29], state-based regions
[9, 23, 42], language-based regions [17, 50], and genetic algorithms [34]. classical synthesis techniques
based on regions [27] cannot be applied directly because the event log contains only example behav-
ior. for state-based regions one ﬁrst needs to create an automaton as described in [9]. moreover, when
constructing the regions, one should avoid overﬁtting. language-based regions seem good candidates
for discovering transition-bordered petri nets for passages [17, 50]. unfortunately, these techniques still
have problems dealing with infrequent/incomplete behavior.
as described in [2], there are four competing quality criteria when comparing modeled behavior and
recorded behavior: ﬁtness, simplicity, precision, and generalization. in this paper, we focused on ﬁtness,
but also precision and generalization can also be investigated per passage. various conformance checking
techniques have been proposed in recent years [7, 11, 12, 14, 20, 26, 29, 35, 36, 41, 46]. conformance
checking can be used to evaluate the quality of discovered processes but can also be used for auditing
purposes [8]. most of the techniques mentioned can be applied to passages. the most challenging part
is to aggregate the metrics per passage into metrics for the overall model and log. we consider the
approach described in [11] to be most promising as it constructs an optimal alignment given an arbitrary
cost function. this alignment can be used for computing precision and generalization [7, 36]. however,
nightly build (see http://www.promtools.org/prom6 ) as of december 7, 2012.32 w. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages
the approach can be rather time consuming. therefore, the efﬁciency gains can be considerable for larger
processes with many activities and passages.
little work has been done on the decomposition and distribution of process mining problems [4].
in [19] an approach is described to distribute genetic process mining over multiple computers. in this
approach candidate models are distributed and in a similar fashion also the log can be distributed. how-
ever, individual models are not partitioned over multiple nodes. therefore, the approach in this paper is
complementary. moreover, unlike [19], the decomposition approach based on passages is not restricted
to genetic process mining.
most related are the divide-and-conquer techniques presented in [24]. in [24] it is shown that region-
based synthesis can be done at the level of synchronized state machine components (smcs). also a
heuristic is given to partition the causal dependency graph into overlapping sets of events that are used to
construct sets of smcs. passages provide a different (more local) partitioning of the problem and, unlike
[24] which focuses speciﬁcally on state-based region mining, we decouple the decomposition approach
from the actual conformance checking and process discovery approaches.
several approaches have been proposed to distribute the veriﬁcation of petri net properties, e.g., by
partitioning the state space using a hash function [18] or by modularizing the state space using localized
strongly connected components [32]. these techniques do not consider event logs and cannot be applied
to process mining.
most data mining techniques can be distributed [21], e.g., distributed classiﬁcation, distributed clus-
tering, and distributed association rule mining [16]. these techniques often partition the input data and
cannot be used for the discovery of petri nets.
this paper is an extended version of a paper presented at petri nets 2012 [3]. many of the results have
been generalized, e.g., from wf-nets to arbitrary nets and from minimal passages to arbitrary passage
partitionings. moreover, the properties of passages are now described in detail and the notion of passages
is supported through various new prom plug-ins. unlike [3] we now also provide experimental results
showing that speedups are indeed possible.
recently, alternative decompositions (other than passages) have been proposed. in [38, 37] it is
shown that so-called sese (single-exit-single-entry) components obtained through the reﬁned process
structure tree (rpst) [39, 43] can be used to decompose conformance checking problems. see [44, 45]
for more experimental results. as shown in [5, 6] passage-based and sese-based decompositions can
be seen as a special case of a more general class of decompositions. the decomposition results in [6] are
general but only apply to petri nets. in [5] the key requirements for decomposing both process discovery
and conformance checking problems are discussed without assuming a petri net representation.
10. conclusion
computationally challenging process mining problems can be decomposed into smaller problems using
the new notion of passages . as shown, conformance checking can be done per passage and the results
per passage can be merged into useful overall conformance diagnostics using the observation that a trace
is non-ﬁtting if and only if it is non-ﬁtting for at least one passage. the paper also presents a discovery
approach where the discovery problem can be decomposed after determining the causal structure. the
reﬁned behavior can be discovered per passage and, subsequently, the discovered net fragments can be
merged into an overall process model. conformance checking and process discovery can be done muchw. van der aalst, h. verbeek / decomposing process mining problems using passages 33
more efﬁciently using such decompositions. moreover, the notion of passages can be used to local-
ize process-related diagnostics. for example, it is easier to explore conformance-related problems per
passage and passages provide a means to hierarchically structure discovered process models. both ap-
proaches have been implemented in prom 6.2 and can be used for decomposing a variety of conformance
checking and process discovery algorithms.
future work will focus on more large scale experiments demonstrating the performance gains when
decomposing various process mining tasks. the experiments in this paper show that the actual speedup
heavily depends on the number of passages and the size of the largest passage. if there are many smaller
passages, orders of magnitude can be gained. however, in worst case, there is just one passage and no
speed-up is possible. ideally, we would like to use a passage partitioning q=fp1;p2;:::;pngsuch
thatnis as large as possible and the passages piare as small as possible. from a practical point of view,
models with just a few large passages are less interesting as, by deﬁnition, they will be spaghetti-like
[2]. to ensure smaller passages, one may need to abstract from edges that are less important. we are
currently investigating such “approximate passages”. clearly, there is a trade-off between the desire to
include all possible causalities and minimizing the average passage size or the size of the biggest passage.
therefore, we would like to investigate  calgorithms that try to minimize the number of passages without
compromising accuracy too much.
